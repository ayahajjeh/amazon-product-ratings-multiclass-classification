it says ""engineered and tested in canada"" but ""made in china"". chinese fuel pumps have a terrible reputation for reliability not that some don't last for a while. my experience conforms to the ""bad"" reputation in that chinese fuel pumps have severely limited life. you might think the quality control at spectra premium (sp) would weed out bad pumps but unless their qa program includes considerable life testing then it's not comprehensive. (btw: life testing a fuel pump could be difficult and costly because you need to run the thing in gasoline for many thousands of hours to assure it meets life requirements. running it in water or even a non-flammable fluid of equivalent viscosity is inadequate because it doesn't adequately replicate the hydrocarbon solubility of gasoline.) walbro and bosch have never failed me but neither offered a drop-in replacement at the time so i chose the sp. mistake! mistake! mistake!

the unit is very well built and seems like it will stand up to use in a professional shop. however my unit is not perfect: after inflating tires the initial displayed will creep downward by as much as 1.4 psi over the period of ~60 seconds. it also happens in the opposite fashion when deflating tires (example: from 50 psi to 32 psi, it the pressure display will creep up to ~33.2 psi after a minute). so instead of returning it (a headache, and i need it for work every day) i just keep this in mind when using it and the pressure hits its target after a minute.

one other tiny issue is that sometimes it doesn't turn on (happened twice in 3 months), i have to remove the rubber cover and remove the batteries for a second so it resets and turns on. if i didn't have the pressure issues above i would give it a 5-star rating.","Solidly built professional grade unit, but with minor pressure display issues.",1486684800,,,,automotive,a221

placed this on my jeep wish list, as the amazon filters said it would fit my 95 jeep wrangler.

1. the one i got has a diamond plate pattern, so not what i wanted in the first place. but i thought, let's give it a shot.

2. the rear floor mat also not as pictured, as in, it's much, much wider. i measured it and my backseat floor area (a mere 35""), and the only way to make this item fit would be to cut that entire piece into two, then trim each leftover rectangle smaller than the lip on the edge, which sort of defeats the purpose of having a floor mat in the winter. in that scenario, all the melting ice and snow would simply leak off onto the carpet i'm trying to protect.

3. i went to return the item, only to find i'd have to pay to ship it back.

4. i got a shipping estimate from ups and usps, and due to weight, return shipping would cost about 28, aka, more than refund amount.

i'd actually be losing money to return a gift in which i received the wrong item in the first place.

5. so we'll see. if their customer service calls me back, maybe we can work something out. i still need floor mats, after all.

still, i gave the product 2 stars because it seems well made and would make someone with the right vehicle happy. if they wanted the diamond pattern that is.","Wrong item, wrong fit, wrong return policy.",1481328000,,,{'Color:': ' Beige'},automotive,a264

(i purchased mine from amazon warehouse deals for about 40% off.)  there's just too much plastic at critical points to warrant that price.

pros:
- installation is a breeze and easy to accomplish with just one person.
- the fabric has a nice matte finish with a slightly rubbery texture.
- the rubber seals are very nice.  there's a flap near the cab that completely overlaps the front edge of the bed.  the bed rail seals are a combined flap and round, hollow rubber seal, so they squish down quite nicely against the bed rails.
- there are black, foam rubber seals/bumpers on all 4 corners.
- the rail on the last fold that holds the cover down against the tailgate can be moved forward or aft for better adjustment.  remove two self-tapping machine screws, move the rail, and then reinstall machine screws.  in its stock position, the rail on my cover was too far away from the tailgate, so even with the clamps in place the rear of the cover near the tailgate stuck up too much.  i moved the rail more toward the tailgate and the cover is held down much better now.

cons:
- most of the frame is metal; however, there are plastic inserts at all 4 clamp positions inserted into the ends of the metal rails.  the clamp mechanisms slide back and forth on these plastic inserts.  in order to get a good, snug fit, those plastic inserts bend rather significantly because of loose tolerances at the point where they insert into the metal rails.  i predict they'll be the first things to fail on the cover.
- the material flaps in the wind hard enough for me to hear it occasionally while traveling at highway speeds.
- the edges of the rubber seals at the two folds tend to catch on the bed rail and curl over on themselves while closing, which prevents the seals from laying flat.  i usually have to help them lay flat as i'm closing each section.
- warning:  if you leave the clamps hanging free and try to open the cover, the clamp bolts will puncture the cover.  there's a sticker on the tonneau cover warning users to ensure that the clamps are locked into their storage position and that damage caused by failing to do so is not covered by the warranty.",Too Much Plastic to Warrant Full Retail Price,1470441600,,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715f8cF9zFL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mvrWqBzxL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ge6UoWh3L._SY88.jpg']",{'Style:': ' Tonno Fold'},automotive,a319

the pro is that it fills up every conceivable space of the windshield so there isn't a sliver of sunshine peeking through.  since it is just a tad too tall, once in place it creates a horizontal fold mid-way.  it creates an unfavorable look from the outside but being my beater commuto-box, i am not interested enough to return the shade.  the fold makes it a bit more difficult to roll up when you're taking it down.  you need to pop the fold in the opposite direction with your hand just a bit to allow it to roll.  seeing how this is a rather large windshield, if you have a passenger next to you, it may be an extra step that gets in the way.

as far as the reflective quality of the outside material, it is excellent.  if you are used to the old cardboard shades or the transparent circular shades, you are in for a treat.  these metallic reflective shades are absolutely the best.  traveling between the deserts of california and arizona, parking my black car outside all day long in 115* temps, i can assure you this type of shade is what you desire.  yes, they fold up vertically and require extra space when stowing them as opposed to the circular sheer shades you can fold up smaller but trust me, those will not keep out half the heat of the metallic shades.

if you don't have a rav4, then i can't promise you anything.  i promise you nothing, in fact.  figure it out for yourselves then post a review.  don't be lazy.",An Inch Too Tall (2008 Toyota Rav4),1378944000,,,{'Color:': ' Blue Metallic'},automotive,a350

the good:

it works very well to push large amounts of snow off cleanly-- even did a better job than my usual brush, with much less effort.

the bad:

the locking mechanism and connection to the ""broom."" my hands were very cold, which made it hard to screw on the foam ""broom"" to the handle, but i got it. then i tried to pull out the telescoping handle, and couldn't. i had to step on the foam and pull up on the handle. that worked. however, it wouldn't stay locked in the ""out"" position. while i was pushing the snow around, the handle kept retracting. that would be pain enough, but here's what was worse:

the handle also kept unscrewing from the foam. the foam was actually spinning around in the wind. i couldn't get it to stay securely on, even though i tightened it as far as it would go. the slightest movement made it loosen and start unscrewing again.

so, in short, i'll still keep it handy because even with the annoyances, it got the job done faster than with a brush and scraper and with less worry about scratching my car, but if i were looking for a snow broom, i'd try a different model first.","Great Idea, But...",1356739200,68.0,,,automotive,a442

1. looks freaking awesome!!!!!
2. pretty easy installation overall.
3. the stubby bumper allows plenty of room for you to roll up to objects and get your tires on it.

cons:
1. the bumper bolts on at eight spots, one bolt was broken when i put the bumper on (i did not know it was broken until i applied pressure to it to tighten the nut and the bolt just spun in place), but the other 7 were solid and i have no issues with the bumper holding onto the frame.
2. there were no bolts for mounting a winch, only the winch plate. this was only an issue because the winch i put on it (smittybilt x2o) did not have bolts that fit this winch mount since the winch plate sits flush on the bumper. i did some research and found that people either but washers on to level it out and the winch plate to bumper had about a 1/8 - 1/4 inch gap....or i could go to the local fastener store and get some bolts with tapered heads that would work and leave the plate flush on the bumper with a winch installed - i did the latter.

recommendations for newer models:
1. space the fog lamps about another inch apart. i just moved to texas and the state requires a front and back license plate. the bumper is tall enough to support the license plate but the plate overlaps the fog lamps about a 1/2 inch on each side. the alternative is to place the license plate below the fog lamps but then the license plate extends below the bumper and could easily be damaged when off roading.",I like it and it looks great.....,1452124800,5.0,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61+QuQN-oVL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WEKwKj5PL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612eDDhF3eL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ujWxBUNYL._SY88.jpg']",,automotive,a464

if you do get one, don't use it right away. first disassemble it and lubricate it properly, which will make it work five times better. the chinese sweat-shop making these uses the wrong grease and not enough. to disassemble, first pull the anvil out of its seat (toward the plunger). do not lube the anvil shank. it turns too freely as it is. now the plunger will pull right out. unscrew the screw. the two ball bearings should fall right out. wipe the cheap grease off all these internal parts. since the plunger has an o-ring, i lubed it with ags / napa sil-glyde. for the screw and bearings i used plenty of lubricating paste identical to air venturi moly metal-to-metal paste. the improvement was dramatic.",It actually works!,1382140800,10.0,,,automotive,a481

 - if you do not have every thing pack correctly the velcro does not reach to the proper place and you cannot close the pouch. if you pack less things, then every thing is loose and comes out of the pouch. they should have put the velcro as a strap and along the pouch so it can be tighten correctly.
 - also, very important! the clear plastic breaks in sub zero weather. so if you plan to use it outdoors in the northern winter, take the items you need out of the pouch before you expose it to the cold temps.

sorry, it's a failed experiment.  neil delivers a pretty pathetic set of lyrics here, relying on his traditional soupy simple rhymes.  they have you gasping at times.  with a few exceptions, the songwriting sounds hurried as if all of the tunes were made up sitting in the studio with a stop watch running.  the sonwriting does improve towards the end of the cd, perhaps because neil tried to front load the cd with unbearable ""hits"" (oh mary, hell yeah, evermore).

overall only a few of the remastered songs sound good compared to other sources, among them : ""a steel guitar & a glas of wine""

everything on this cd sounds very mid frequency emphasis and this has destroyed the warmth of the recordings.

sound quality was a great disappointment,: puppy love ,tonight my love tonight, adam & eve, lonely boy, dance on little girl, my home town [dreadful! on tis one] etc

the songs listed above sound much better on ""paul anka classic songs my way 2cd 50th anniv univ oz 2007"" with much more warmth & fuller frequency spectrum & nice bass .

for one of his biggest songs ""put your head on my shoulder"" the sound quality is far superior on:
""lipstick on your collar 3cd onedaymusic2011""

i will agree she was at onetime a great dancer and i think that was all she really had going for her as far as talent goes.

rather than unleash this in it's current format it would have been interesting to see what would have happened if the demos were taken and worked on hashing them out to a higher musical ilk.

i suppose standards are lowered these days. and that is unfortunate. perhaps they can get together again to take the demos and hash it out to a more palatable form. and perhaps they can even offer to accept copies of this format in trade for what should have been done in the first place. that would be the merciful thing to do in this case.

""average girl"" is one song on the album that makes absolutely no sense to me.

this song is about staying sexually pure before you marry, at least that's what i think it's about...

the lyrics in the chorus read...

no more dating

i'm just waiting

like sleeping beauty

my prince will come for me

by this point, i'm really beside myself. like come on! ""no more dating""?????? how the heck are you supposed to get married if you don't date!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? look at a guy and go ""oh ya, he's hott! will you marry me?""  i mean come on.

and last time i heard someone compare themselves to sleeping beauty, i was five and in disney world. and incase you haven't noticed barlow girl, sleeping beauty never happened. so if it didn't happen to a real princess, it's not going to happen to you.

parents, if you're looking for good music for your teen, get music that actually makes sense. i mean, korn makes more sense then that!!!!

over all, the only decent song on the album is without a doubt, ""never alone"". even though i wouldn't call it rock, and i wouldn't buy the cd for it.

i wouldn't one-star something unless i feel pretty confident repeated listens won't redeem my gut instinct, and here's a case where that instinct is all you need to follow. replacing his usual understated elegance with an edge would have been one thing, but punishing his listeners with the cartoonish bash of bar chords, ambiguous and politically-doctrinaire lyrics, f-bombs out of the icp book of subtlety, and impressionistic takes on capital-c classic rock are an entirely different story.  this album is the most unnerving, left-field crash-and-burn i've ever been fooled into waiting for. it would be mighty unfair to compare ""tomorrowland"" to his previous three masterpieces, but it's pretty apparent he didn't intend to follow that path either, he'd rather make a ""statement"". fair enough.

this album is such an arrogant mess it's hard to lay blame on a single specific problem. the music itself is like a whiny drill that never ends, without a single place to come up for air. apparently he feels the only way he can be heard above the din is to make his own screech, to compete head-on with the ""wasteland"" he used to not be interested in. and it's all a charade: ""never far behind"" and ""western shore"" build a distant theme until you realize it's bait, you're just waiting around for the band to come crashing in, reeeeal heavy and thick, with no ability to let something unfold without narrating it with more slowly-building torrential chordage for emphasis. (opener ""beg for broken legs"" also uses this prop, and results in being the most hilarious thing i've listened to in years.) ""flower bomb"" is a yelp away from being an outtake off ""the rising"", which is okay i suppose, but when tom petty's ""runnin' down a dream"" is aped two tracks later (with more linear bar chords), you begin to get the point. halfway through, i saw this as a full-on nosedive so complete, so comical that i had to laugh at ""guess who's knockin"" and its eric church/arena-ready yelps designed to produce the inevitable ""wooooo!!"" from section 403. ""how you doin out there, tampaaaaaaa!"" and speaking of talking to his audience, the lyrics here are incessant - everything is full of noise and chatter and on and on and on. by the time ""rising from the ghetto"" faded out on the chaotic mess of delay/space-echo guitar squall and bashing-over-your-head drums, i was exhausted and didn't care.

i'm now on my second copy of this collection.  with the first one, two of the four discs had such bad abrasions from the cardboard slots that they didn't play properly.  i returned that set to a local retailer for a refund.

then, i decided to try buying the collection from amazon, even though the price was higher, thinking that i might have better luck.  no dice.  again, the same two discs (1 and 3, because of the way the carboard slots are constructed) have bad abrasions.  i'll try listening to them to see if they play, but if they don't, i'll be returning the set to amazon for a refund and give up on this collection altogether.  if they do play, i'll be storing the discs in jewel cases to protect them properly, rather than returning them to rhino's poorly designed holders.

for people like me (and other reviewers here) who are stuck with damaged discs, rhino should make replacements available -- it would probably be cheaper for them than having all of us simply return the whole set for a refund.

i hate the prospect of not having this collection, because it does contain a lot of great music and the book is really interesting.  so i hope the discs will play properly this second time.

this box set has cash grab written all over it. it's just the next product in a line of crap that ozzy and sharon have been pushing to get even richer off of. and you think with being a millionaire you could atleast pay royalties to the musicians who helped you get there in the first place. sharons eyes must look like this $ $ now becuse of her manipulative ability to market ozzy who has now become nothing more then a puppet. ozzy's musical ability died once the original line up for his solo band disolved in 82 or 83. after that it was all down hill because ozzy can't write songs, plain and simple, it is just imposible for him technicaly. all of his lyrics were/are written for him,  from the earliest days in sabbath up till now. don't support this corprate greed machine known as the osbournes, i was horrifed when two of my favorite albums (blizzard and diary) were discontieud and replaced with (...) versions. i effing hate you ozzy, you are the biggest (...) in the music buisness and i hope bob and lee reopen the court case some how and sue your greedy @ss so you,your money loving wife and your two ignoramus kids for every penny you have. ifthe guy below me is right ( and i have a feeling he is) about ozzy useing recorded backing vocals for his shows now because he is too effing lazy to sing for his fans, this is truely the end. i was also p.o.ed about the comment he made about ronnie james dio (who has one million times the talent), he has no right mainly because dio is a musician and writes his own songs!

""cosi fan tutti frutti"" is one of them.

in fact, in a band who's two songwriters both play guitar (difford & tilbrook) quite well, there is bafflingly little guitar on this album.  the synthesizer sounds and fretless bass of new (at the time) bassist keith wilkinson, as well as a lot of wacky synthy drum sounds, dominate the sonic spectrum.

which could possibly be tolerable if the typical difford/tillbrook quality songwriting ruled the day, but it really sounds to me like they took a couple of good songs into the studio and made up the rest as they went.  to my ears, the well was a bit on the dry side.

""symphony"" is a re-release of last year's ""christmas voices"" but now titled to reflect their current abbreviated tour with various symphonies throughout the east coast.  this time however, george's version of ""mary's boy child"" is missing, as is one of the stars i gave ""voices.""  as many of you will recall, he died suddenly this year, shortly after their u.s. tour.  so...this version has 14 songs instead of 15.  it may just be me, but i am not very pleased with ct manager sharon brown these days - although these very talented men with their wonderful voices are still capable of wowing even the most jaded listeners, i'm sure.  it's just that lately, there is a focus on finances and not on creating new music.  there's a ""new"" fan club with ""tiers"" of membership that require a monthly financial commitment and give the donors extra benefits and will supposedly help finance the group when they are not touring, cruising, etc.  there is also a ""free"" membership however - to be honest.  there was a large reaction from fans who will not be able to see holiday symphony, and partially because of this, there has been a ""new"" tour arranged that will begin in 2015 and will consist of long-time favorites.  my biggest concern, and reason for skipping that performance is that before ""mythology"" was released, we were told that the prior tour including ""voyage"" was to give fans a final opportunity to hear the group perform many of their original favorites.  (it was said on brown's biog!)  so...i guess now we have a third chance at that, but i'm retired and disabled, and to pay $92 per ticket ($250 if you buy from pbs), for music i've already heard more than once in concert is a bit rich for my blood.  (garth brooks' latest concerts had seats available as low as $35, and they were still good seats.)  as far as holiday symphony/christmas voices go, my review from voices stands (with some notes)  i will miss both george and emmet cahill - and i know that the members of ct will as well.  their new tenor, a u.s.-born irishman is good, but to me his voice tends to be more polished - like a paul byrom.  i loved the feel of emmet cahill's music.  byrom was a classically-trained tenor and his performance was slick and swanky and always the same.  emmet could sing it and every time you'd get his full range of emotion accompanying it so you would feel it as well as listen to it.  i've said that he could sing me the phone book and i'd be delighted - and this is what i meant by that.  it doesn't mean that i'm abandoning ct, on the contrary.  i'm just waiting for something new and fresh and not re-recordings of music i've already purchased.

this is the first time i've ever given celtic thunder less than 5 stars, so let me elaborate on that first. starting with ""mythology"" it seems as if it's hard to figure out where to buy their music - at their site to get extra songs, from pbs to get tickets, or from amazon and/or wal-mart to get a shorter version. this time we had only two choices - direct from ct or through amazon. what they didn't do this time, and which really irks me, is that they didn't make it available via mp3! (note:  you can get ""symphony"" on mp3)  as i said above, george's ""mary's boy child"" is gone, along with one star. . .personally, i think their first christmas album was better, but i think it's just in the choice of songs, not the voices. as always, the solos are superb - neal's ""mary's did you know?"" is beautiful, and emmet's ""oh holy night"" is just amazing - he's gone though.  the simple arrangement on ""away in a manger"" makes you picture colm as a child singing it in church - that clear, pure tone is perfect for it. the surprise for me of all the solo songs was ""comfort ye"" from ""the messiah"" by handel as performed by keith--it was unusual to hear him doing this, and the more i hear it the more i like it!  that leaves ryan kelly with ""in the bleak mid-winter."" it's a song i've never heard and seems to suit his darker tones. i really wish they'd stop with that - he has so much more to offer than his dark destroyer persona!  truthfully, i like his solo albums and duo ""acoustic by candelight"" performances with neal byrne.

the other new songs for me were ""fairytale of new york"" and gaudet  . . . both were good, but there are so many others that would have been a better choice. ""carol of the bells"" came first, and was beautifully done. then we have the ""christmas medley"" which has a glitch on my cd - would have loved the longer versions of any of these, especially ""parade of the wooden soldiers"". ""gabriel's message"" was another i wasn't familiar with, but which i can see becoming a favorite! ""the christmas song"" by mel torme could have been written for these guys - it's another of my favorites! the finale was ""o come all ye faithful"" and was okay too.

i don't quite know what it is with this title - it's okay, but i've become so used to ""wonderful"" and ""incredible"" in connection with ct, that it's almost - but not quite - a - well, i don't know.  do you get what i mean?  (final note:  perhaps sharon browne heard me, they've changed the title to ""holiday symphony.""  if you have ""voices"" then don't spend the extra $$$ on this.  if you really want a christmas cd from ct, then buy their first one.  much better - and you can get it from amazon!",I have issues with this!,1417132800,21.0,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a906

this varese cd unhappily exists, with its unflattering cover photography, for better or worse, and the mundane musicianship is solid without ever being arresting or exciting. much of it is deadly dull, a real demerit for producer ray pennington and his fledgling indie step one. the original concept was ambitious: price was to rerecord his entire core hits repertoire, vocal chops intact and deeper in his 60th year, in modern sound and with a new generation of studio pickers (who sound benumbed here, unaware that this might have morphed into a truly historic series of gigs similar to bob wills' for the last time). there were three full albums of the bigger hits (the honkytonk classics dumbed down and smoothed over for timid modern listeners), plus a fourth disc addendum of leftovers sung ""by request."" step one issued four separate vinyls, cassettes and even a cd twofer covering vols. 1-3. that integral reissue is still available for diehard completists, and this varese followup further digests the primo hits from price's countrypolitan ""tuxedo period."" the ambience (oh, the echoic 1958 mono reverb of ""city lights"") in the classic and readily available sony originals, lovingly produced in dallas and nashville by don law, is sorely missed, and these bland, easy-listening rerecordings are a very minor footnote in an illustrious and influential career.

with supreme irony, the original appendix, ray price's greatest hits, vol. 4, is still available as a step one cd, and its remakes and originals (""spanish eyes,"" ""invitation to the blues,"" ""somewhere in texas""), performed with considerable spark and gusto, completely outstrip the tepid entirety of vols. 1-3 and this lame and lackluster distillation thereof.","NONESSENTIAL DISAPPOINTMENTS, FOR COMPLETISTS ONLY",1422230400,,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a917

from the onset the listener is hit with displaced samples, chunky riffing and electronically augmented beats that revel in a futuristic sense of evil. hooky choruses and driving rhythms are constantly attempted, yet without the charisma of one of the brothers zombie at the helm they are quickly driven into the ground and hastily buried. sure there are moments where this group deviate from the formula of their previous outfits, taking the time to develop an ominous soundscape or two. they even try their hand at a shaky ballad. but with such a derivative nature and little more creativity than that of a cover band being exercised (or does their gimmick call for exorcised?), not even the dead would be interested by what is offered up here, let alone the undead.

beats [d-] awful almost all the way through. hold on we're coming home is the only saving grace here.
hooks [f] from started from the bottom to all me, it's boring, lazy and overall would have been better if left unattempted
flow [b] one of the better parts of the album, drake is able to stay on top of the beats well, but especially on songs like started from the bottom, he sounds high the whole time, it's decent overall but not great.
lyrics [a] the only saving grace on this album. drake goes incredibly deep with some of these lyrics, which is to be appreciated with the rap game so repetitive now-a-days
originality [b+] it's original all right. but that doesn't mean it's good. you won't hear an album like this one, and though it's deep, the production is pretty bad.

singles [f] started from the bottom was an atrocity to rap music and only furthers the stereotype that drake is a bad rapper (which he isn't by any means). all me was probably the laziest and most stereotypical rap song of the year. wu-tang forever is just straight up boring, while hold on we're going home stands as the only song worth listening to of the four. unfortunately, those four songs were the only ones that had any mainstream potential.

nothing was the same is without a doubt drake's weakest album to date. with take care being so original and enjoyable most of the way through, it's disappointing to see drake release such a repetitious and boring album that has absolutely no excitement at all. yeah the lyrics are great, but production wise, this album is just awful.

final score: 4/10

the title track (and first single) will probably be a deserved semi-hit. it's the most immediate thing on the album and fits mccartney's thin, nasal voice. in fact, much of the album is full of retreads of the first song, though all are inferior. worst of all are right back in the water and tell her, or as i like to call them, droopy ballad #1 and droopy ballad #2. neither of these songs have the bombast or vulnerability that superior teenage ballads exhibit. better is invincible, which tells the story of a fatal drinking-and-driving accident. lyrically it's obvious, but at least mccartney seems to feel it. less successful are can't let you go and we can go anywhere, a pair of atrociously detached rockers.

jesse mccartney is better suited to radio disney fair. after all, beautiful soul and because you live (both off his major label debut) were legit, catchy pop hits. while they were undeniably bubblegum, they were also fun and urgent. right where you want me is neither. instead it's a long, arduous collection of factory-pressed wannabe-rock that feels hollow and forgettable.

yet even on ziggy stardust, one becomes acutely aware that the nature of the album revolves around tragedy, and as on black star is delivered through the narrative by an almost disembodied voice, who may or may not have been the central character, or perhaps is simply a kindred spirit who was privy to the story as it was unfolding.  bowies music has always seemed to be filled with rather high contrast black & white imagery, hes always seemed to be a man whos constantly viewing himself, and having said that, he seems to be a man whos always lied to his fans, merely relaying a suggestive undercurrent of whom he actually is, favoring instead to become the characters in his songs, even to the point where here on black star, one is left wondering if hes actually writing about his own death, and the times in which his death will occur, or if hes even here, created the personification of a caricature whos standing in for him at this moment in time, connecting his past with his unsure future, while sampling images of the ill fated iconic characters hes both developed and lived through.

never does it seem that we have ever met the real man, say perhaps on hunky dory.  we never met him as an actual dj, nor was he really there as kisses were exchanged under a hail of bullets, he was rejecting fame in the song fame, yet wrapping himself ever more deeply in the cloak of fame, becoming a famous person withdrawn from society and a normal walk to the corner store.  there is an unshakable duality to bowie, one that harkens back to his bicoloured eyes, which was not caused by heterochromia, but from a playground fight, with this duality becoming a central theme for all of his music.  this duality cut deeply into his albums, where after ziggy stardust his material became laced with more and deeper experimental concepts, nearly to the point that there was merely one or two pop songs that gained radio attention, as if to capture our imaginations, and once the door was open, were face to face with conceptualized music that most people didn't listen to, preferring to purchase his hits albums.  so in effect, this pop star icon was evoking more of a robert fripp response, or even the 1963 collaboration john coltrane did with johnny hartman, where the protagonist occupies a private nocturnal world, one filled with his own fantasies of demons, devils and angels, one that he doesnt seem to truly comprehend, leaving these sketches to his band to translate, then stepping in to tweak, stepping in to install a liner translation.

yes, its impossible to consider black star without looking back and looking within, both at the man and at ourselves [as listeners].  with that in mind, and seeming for this reviewer, to be the central and insurmountable aspect to this last release, and i must tell you that i find it to be his most disturbing, most uncomfortable, and most unlistenable of albums.  of course i can accept the fact that this is just me not wanting  to confront my own mortality, yet ive seriously confronted my mortality more times than i care to remember, having nearly died more than once.  black star is filled with minor chord riffs, where bowie gives actual weight to each word, while emphasizing both the music and the lyrics with snares of disdain, as if he is attempting to ignore the scratching at his door.  others have said that it was a shrewd move to keep his own company and his silence for so long, and then burst on the scene to deliver this his most scary and tragic outing of all time  because as he was writing he was dying from his own hand, knowing this, angry that he was hungry for more life and not ready to make peace with himself and his death, leaving him to be the proverbial cracked actor.

if you love this album then i am very happy for you.  if you feel that bowie is sticking pins in our eyes, then im with you, feeling that this is a man, who as in life, is cryptically and melodramatically doling out visions of his life and final days, rather than shedding his skin, celebrating his life, his fans and the wonder of his nature by delivering us a visionary rock n roll, even if it is of the unplugged sort, of this final frontier, one that far too few artists have been able to script into verse and song.

but then, in all honesty, not believing in heaven or hell, and hating the annoyance of cell phones, i could have, and should have, expected exactly what i found here on black star, an ambiguous album filled with scary monsters and no heroes, one that doesnt see bowie moving forward, but rather reaching the end of the line, a passenger who will never step off of the train, an album i find too uncomfortable to even keep in my collection.

first, before you proponents of this record yell at me. i get it. this isn't zeppelin and should not be treated as such.

what i will drive home is there are so many things wrong with this record.

first, with two capable musicians and having such a storied history one would expect a effort with more ""kick."" other reviewers have said it and i concur - this record feels well - tired. there is no spunk, no energy and nothing that grabs you by your wrists and demands you listen. what you get it is a meandering mediocre (did i just say that?  - yup) record that takes you nowhere. i'll go one step further if two unknowns had cut an album like this i doubt it would've even been released.

second, the mix is total crap. i have no clue why jimmy didn't produce. we know he's incredibly capable in this department. my only thought this is another ""plantism."" which turned out to be the kiss of death. take out the heart and soul leaving only a sterile midrangy recording with no ummphy bass and searing leads - its painful to listen to after awhile.

third, the songwriting. we know these guys can write some great stuff. where is it? only a few tunes merit a passing interest. best example of this is the hit ""most high.""  other than that, we're left with one listen wonders. tunes you hear and go ""my god, this is boring.""

its not say this record is bad. its just such a huge letdown. i don't know what the lads were going for. the mature rock audience? if so, they missed badly. they should've just been themselves. bringing in albini to produce - they don't need to cater to the nirvana mallrats. be themselves, set the trend don't try emulate something they think is hot.

bottom line here i view this record as a plant solo record. you ask why? its obvious to me plant wore the pants here. he dictated the feel and much of the approach of this record. jimmy left to his own devices would crank out something more akin to coverdale/page - the guitar army in force. the guitar army was left locked outside the studio on this one.

this is not an accessible record - even for moderately interested people. heck being a fan of zep i want to get into this - i try to get into it once a year. i've still been unable to. it simply doesn't connect on any level to me.

don't buy this if just starting. this one is for diehards.

makes you wonder if this was a case of sabotage (plant has been accused of it before). or a shining example that the magic of years past wasn't all jimmy and percy. they just got all the glory of it.

new edition has been away for 10 years - you would think that some of the performers  could have collectively come up with some new hooks and harmonies jointly or each on their own.

instead - they seem to have picked up some b- grade material and beats that could have been lying around bad boy for any group or singer to come along and blow. these really are not bad boy's best beats - or songs. and they are really not sounding like they were hard working to improve the lackluster material.

the cuts produced by jimmy jam and terry lewis have their typical polish and groove (which makes them the best cuts on the album) - but are not nearly as inspired as the work jam & lewis  did with n.e. on the ""heartbreak"" album. jam & lewis still have the touch - but their songs on this album sound like standards - breaking no new ground - and not really testing the groups vocals with anything innovative.

this cd came out in 1986 when people were still experimenting with the relatively new cd technology and digital recording was really starting to take off.  this and cobhams' first grp cd, warning, are all about experimenting with the sonic and dynamic qualities possible with digital technology.

the sound on this cd is wonderful and at the time unique. some of the instruments have a very beautiful sound.  the drumming is very deep and sharp.  the dynamic range and precision of the sound are far superior to any of cobham's earlier work.  some of his lp's were especially bad, with all the pops and hissing that come with vinyl.

but, it takes more that just beautiful sound to make a good cd.  it takes good compositions.  this cd does not have them.  it is very boring music that sounds great.

it is suggested that you sample this cd from a used cd shop to convince yourself that you will like this.  well, if you sample 20 to 30 seconds of this music, you will love it, because of the wonderful sound and nice playing.  but, listening to the whole cd is not a wonderful experience.  you quickly get bored, and the whole thing becomes background music as your mind wanders off on to something else.

this cd consists of 7 shorter (around 4 minutes) tracks plus a 6 track suite, called excerpts from summit afrique, that is 16 minutes long.  i don't know why he called this ""excerpts from"".  is there a more complete version somewhere?.  this suite is the most interesting and most completely realized composition on the cd.  if all the tracks were along this line, the cd might be worth buying.

i have never been a fan of the grp style of lite jazz.  i think that artists like cobham, chick corea and tom scott have done the weakest work while on the grp label.  it is a white bread jazz for the masses, to cash in on the very popular sunday brunch jazz movement that started in the mid-eighties.  it is the music you now hear in a dentist's office.  literally.  i just heard it yesterday, when i went to see the dentist.

this album is one of the greatest debuts ever by a rock band and is essential listening for fans and aspirants of good rock guitaring.  although all the tracks have been tuned down to e flat tuning for the guitar (so if you've been trying to play along with the cd and have been finding it hard to do so this is the reason) some of rock guitar's standards are on this album and especially so for ""eruption"" which is a tour de force of guitar flash playing.  the extremely tasty guitar licks on all the other tracks are also worth the purchase price of this baby.

her voice is not very country.  and the songs are not country songs!
listen to them.  they are really her traditional folk/pop style songs,

there to try to give them a country sound.  i think this makes
the arrangements clumsy and insincere.

i found myself feeling that every one of the songs would have
been much better with some electric guitars and piano, and played
more like rock songs, instead of using the
countrified instrumentation that feels way out of place.

songwriting-wise, the gem in the whole set is ""'til it feels like cheating"".  that could be a great country song.  it's got the slightly-offbeat unsettling story-telling that is the hallmark of a truly great country lyric.  you don't expect a woman to describe her passion with her man to be ""like cheating.""  it's dangerous, a little racy, yet sincere and warm.  unfortunately, jewel's voice is all wrong for this kind of song.",Not Country - doesn't work,1212969600,7.0,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a979

""young'n (holla back)"" which was probably his biggest hit yet, is a slightly annoying neptunes produced track where fabolous raps good enough to get by. the fourth track is the final straw, ""get right"" .... how can he sample junior mafia and get away with it? this song not only makes no sense but fabolous raps awful throughout the whole thing. ""ride for this"" features another 'gangsta' [copy], ja rule, but has the beat to pass with a c-. ""one day"" is too slow and personal so i think it should fail. ""trade it all"" with jagged edge is another slow based song (the remix is better) and the skit following it is stupid. ""right now & later on"" is a timbaland produced club banga that i think deserves an a+ on all sides. fabolous raps worthy of the timbaland beat and the chorus drew me in and wouldn't let go. the rest of the album, including ""can't deny it"" with nate dogg, isn't worth listening to. aside from ""can't deny it"", its all just fabolous's [copy] gangsta attitude on all the rest of the tracks, including the two untitled bonus tracks. my idea of ""ghetto fabolous"" is that fabolous aka ma$e's little brother needs to get off the 'i'm a gangsta' thing and make an album worthy of more than 2 stars.

1. bye bye bye (3/5)
i personally think this song is way overated!  this song is nothing compared to ""tearin up my heart"" from their first album.  i was hoping for better because most of the time the first song is the strongest part of the whole cd!  this was a bad start for a cd!  let's hope they don't do the same thing with their third album.
2. it's gonna be me (5/5)
now this is the way the album should have started!  with a great song!  although they choose to use their skweaky voices for this song, they got everything else with it right!  i hope to here more like this!
3. space cowboy (yippie-yi-yay) - featuring lisa ""left eye"" lopes (1/5)
okay, whose idea was this!  why the heck did n'sync decide to do a cheap rap song?  it makes me sad that n'sync are also teaming up with a cheap artist like lisa ""left eye"" lopes!  n'sync, you can do better than this!
4. just got paid (2/5)
although i liked this song as much as i liked the last one, at least this has a good note in the middle somewhere.  but that's not saying much.
5. it makes me ill (1/5)
what's up with you guys!  why are you ruining your carears with songs like these!  yet we get another cheap rap song from n'sync!  unless n'sync gets their marbles straight they won't last much longer!  after listening to this (and the last two) songs on this album i don't think eminem needs to call them n'stink because at the moment they do!
6. this i promise you (5/5)
finally!  we get a good song, and what a song it is too!  the song is harmanized perfectly with great vocals, and a beutiful melody!  now this is the tallent n'sync is known for, and they should continue doing songs like these!  bravo!
7. no strings attached (3/5)
although annoying at times, i think this is a pretty good track!  not my type of style, but i think this wasn't too bad!
8. digital get down (2/5)
okay, we're back to bad songs.  n'sync, i've lost alot of respect for you now.  all this song is about is cybersex!  what about the kids who look up to you guys?  i'm tellen you, you really screwed up this time.  if you're music comes anywhere close to getting more like this i will stop buying your albums as i too have kids, and i don't want my kids listening to trash like this!
9. bringin' da noise (1/5)
unless you plan on listen this with a bunch of cats, this is a terrable dance song!  all they do is say ""bring in the moise"" through out the song.  n'sync, you're starting to scare me.
10. that's when i'll stop loving you (5/5)
we've gotten (despite all the other dissasters on this cd) anouther great song from n'sync!  the vocals are on track, the melody is sweat and sooth, and this is a great song to listen to on a date!  great job!  keep up the great work (really work on the great work after some of the other songs you've sung on this cd! )!
11. i'll be good for you (3/5)
although not my favorite, it's an okay song.  but the vocals are way out of place here!  work on this n'sync.
12. i thought she knew (5/5)
unlike the weak opening we got on this cd, we are treated with a wonderful closing to the cd!  there is no music in this song, so it relies strickly on n'sync's vocal talent to pull off the job!  and gusse what?  they succeded!  this is a great powerful song that after awhile you can't tell if they're just singing, or if they're playing music in the background also!  a great song!  listen to it if you havn't already!
so although i was a big fan of n'sync, after the album is finished they failed to pull off great second album (third if you coun't their christmas album).  hopefully they'll turn around and pull it off with their third album!  and hopefully they'll includ their best songs, ""music of my heart"" (from the movie ""music of the heart""), somewhere someday (from the movie ""pokemon: the first movie""), and my personal favorite of all their songs ""if only in heavens eyes"" (from the movie ""light it up"")!","What Happened?

it's an admirable thing to pay tribute to a band like the beatles. but, it's also a very hazardous thing. i don't see the point in this ""re-visitation"" of the classic beatles album. it adds nothing to the beatles mystique, nor does it build upon the band's legendary status. it's a jumble of different musical styles that don't go well together.

there is one bright spot on this cd, and that is dar williams's version of ""you won't see me"". she carries the entire 2-star rating from me.

call me a grouch if you will... but, if i want to hear ""rubber soul"", i'll listen to the actual beatles album.... if i want to hear a different version of ""i'm looking through you"" - performed in a different style then the original version - i'll listen to disc 1 of ""the beatles anthology 2"".

some might say that tributes like this one might get the beatles new listeners. if this cd gets some younger music listeners to get into the beatles, then that's fine. but, when i was a budding music lover in the late 70's-early 80's, i was listening to the real thing. so...

beatles tributes are great, but you've got to make sure and get it right. this compilation does not get it right. if you want to hear some excellent recent beatles covers - a more inspired collection of bealtes covers? then check out the soundtrack (""music inspired by the film"") to ""sam i am"".

i was looking forward to this reissue but unfortunately, it's no different that the ""2000 silver edition"" (or whatever it was). the track listing is identical...except the ""crab society demos"" which are in fact, unlistenable due to the poor quality.

2. remastering - unfortunately, the original source tapes are so awful that no amount of eq, compression and 21-century wizardry could tidy up the swamp. i had my hopes up after hearing what a good job rhino did with the drama album, but after listening to rhino's tormato and comparing it with the original cd & vinyl releases, all i can say is: ""well, it was a noble effort."" tormato is, was, and ever shall be very thin: muddy bass, nonexistent midrange and tinny guitars. (please don't ask about the keyboards and vocals which are trebly to begin with.)

my personal opinion is that the main guitar ( other than the accoustic guitars) is consistently out of phase. this works fine with a second backing guitar, but not for a main guitar. the booklet, stated to be part of this epic work, looks like it was done partly by a pre-school art class. on vocals alone, this cd is out of the much vaunted class that it hopes to echo.

i don't usually do track by track but:

1. this is turgid and derivative ambient drivel.
2. very much the poor mans ripper owens ... not rock ... not allayed with zep, floyd or acdc.
3. like an acdc knock off in parts. attempts to be an intelligent lyrical work ""we're on the road to nowhere"", and it copies acdc chorus style singing ( badly) as created by macka. the guitar sounds like a 78 epiphone using front pickups.
4. shades of tony iommi meets angus young. dreadful guitar sounds, and lyrics that give a deja vu sense ( as in, i have heard that before).
5. this was a real shocker for me as a status quo fan since the guitars sound so derivative, with the exception that the solos are truly lousey and unplanned, and definitely uninspired in any sense.

i wrote more notes on this cd, but its a waste of space here; with the exception of some tolerable accoustic elements the rest is just all down hill, and so very derivative, and not even a shadowy copy of the great led zeppelin, pink floyd and acdc.

the primary problem is that there are really no good songs here. i am also not a fan of female vocalists who `scream' out all the lyrics, rendering them incomprehensible. christina aguilera has this same problem, which was why her ""back to basics"" record was so dismal. kelly on the other hand, can show restraint when given the right song (aka the beautiful ""because of you"" from a few years ago). here, however, every note seems overwrought, every other song seems yelled out, and there is absolutely no sense of fun, let alone depth.

the lead single, which tune-wise is the best thing here, stands out in stark comparison to the kara dioguardi-penned second track, which is also the second single. i kid you not, this sounds like some leftover album track from a miley cyrus record, or worse still, a hilary duff record circa 2003. and not in a good way. i understand the need for pop-rock elements in albums these days, and avril lavigne and ashlee simpson have all had some success with it, but they were really crossing that line here, with screechy guitars and hilarious riffs all supposed to be `songs'. personally i found this album a total waste of time, and to think i paid full retail for it.

heres the thing - kelly clarkson's best album was ""my december"" and of course not many people bothered to buy that one. this is a far inferior, subpar album and i am a loss for words as to how its getting all these glowing reviews. tracks 4-7 sound almost identical. no change in key, no difference in chorus even. every semi-quietish verse blows up into a samey-sounding chorus. this worked well on ""since you've been gone"", but at least that song had a good tune. everything here is bland and lifeless - quite a letdown.

why? well, you'd understand if you listened to the album. i wouldn't necessarily call bone crusher's rhymes garbage, but they're not all that great either. and the album's introduction, which is the second track (i still can't figure that one out), has jermaine dupri hyping bone up, saying that he's representing the south, that he and his clique are ""never scared"", blah, blah, blah. like bone crusher is the first rapper out of atlanta or something?
it's hard to tell this is a debut album anyway because, as so often is the case, there are way too many guest stars on here (even in the interludes), and most of the time it's people that no one has ever heard of. songs like ""gettin' it (get dat money)"" and ""it's me"" are nothing special, and rapper chyna whyte doesn't make things better in the aforementioned song with lines like: ""ima ride till i can't ride/drink till i can't drink/flow till i can't flow/blow till i can't blow."" i have no idea what's going on in ""the wall"", and ""ghetto song"" and ""peaches & cream"" sound like last-minute songs.
when bone has known guest stars, things get better...well, somewhat. ""never scared"" is okay, and it's nice that it features the underrated killer mike, but i wasn't that impressed with t.i. (not that i ever am). and the goodie-mob assisted ""hate ourselves"" is a little iffy; furthermore, the ""new"" goodie mob (sans cee-lo) singing the chorus just doesn't work as well.
most of these songs are hard to enjoy anyway because of bone's overstated rhyme style: the screaming. if he had some better rhymes, that might be all right. and the few times he's not screaming, he sounds like a clone of ja rule or caddillac tah, i'm not sure which. and another thing, whoever produced this album needs to step their game up, because a lot of these songs have similar beats.
i think bone crusher got signed to so so def only because jd wanted somebody on the label who's older than he is. but anyway, this album really isn't that impressive. it's probably still okay to bump in your ride, but i'll wait till his next album to hear some really dope stuff.

and, with few exceptions, this album proves how misguided this whole concept was. the inclusion of melissa ethridge is annoying but predictable; the fact that she gets more tunes on this 2-cd package than springsteen, dylan, johnny cash or any other artist is beyond belief. it would be understandable if she did something special but she is dull as dishwater, screaming ""hello cleveland!"" (that's a deep sentiment repeated ad nauseum by almost every singer on this cd) before screeching ""can you remember the fine days when rock and roll...wore a drrrrrrress?!?!?!"" kind of an odd sentiment coming from a woman who refuses to wear dresses, but that's neither here nor there, the important thing to keep in mind is that etheridge can't sing and has an extremely hard time finding the melodies of the three classic tunes she tackles. the ronettes and supremes were due more homage than this.
disc 1 is rescued, temporarily, by al green, the most underrated singer of his generation, who turns in gorgeous renditions of ""tired of being alone"" and ""a change is gonna come,"" but chrissie hynde does her very best to break the mood by screaming the name of every cleveland suburb at the top of her lungs before phoning in a lackluster mumbling of ""my city was gone.""
after that things pick up for quite a while. johnny cash, aretha franklin, james brown, john fogarty all deserved more space on disc 1, and jerry lee lewis rocks on disc 2. springsteen's ""shake rattle & roll"" is surpisingly slow and doesn't display the boss's usual energy, but he understands what he's doing, something that can't be said for every act on this cd.
once the killer and the boss leave the stage, the show collapses. natalie merchant, jackson browne, bruce hornsby and especially the allman brothers all phone it in, stumbling through dull performances of songs it makes no sense for them to sing. browne's version of bob marley's great ""redemption song"" is downright shameful, and it is embarassing to listen to slash trying to remember the guitar parts to hendrix' ""red house.""
most annoying of all are the constant reminders that the show is in cleveland, cleveland rocks, this is for cleveland and, over and over and over, ""hello cleveland!!!"" outside the city limits, who cares?!? for whatever reason, the rock and roll hall of fame has decided that cleveland is the center of the universe...which probably goes a long way towards explaining why this album, and the hall itself, have been ignored everywhere outside of ohio.
the hall may have been a good idea, and the concept of this cd--a group of rock giants covering classic rock tunes in front of a live audience--is a good idea. unfortunately, the reality of the hall and the cd fall far short of the dream.","Goodbye, Cleveland",1068163200,24.0,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1019

instead, what i found was a record full of selections verging on pop. i'm certain that this project will be well received by the contemporary christian market, but for those of us who know ron block as a first rate bluegrass banjo and guitar player, and songwriter, this cd is a major letdown. while it features a couple outstandingly well written tunes, the large majority all seem to converge onto the same subject, both lyrically and musically.

this cd shows an almost complete absence of his strengths and surprising reliance on his biggest weakness--his voice. great songs are not the norm here. most songs are average with arrangements that are too reminiscent of other artists' songs.

blake is for the most part singing everything from lead vocals to background vocals, but his voice isn't strong enough for this. for that matter, it falls apart on the ballads. in one case (without you), it's obvious it's a potentially great song, but blake struggles with the melody. he sounds like a half-dead rooster at times and a really bad karaoke singer at others. particularly dreadful is when the music practically stops and he sings a few notes with just one instrument. everything that is wrong with his voice just stands out. it just seems he could fit in well with a boy band, but going solo is just not working.

for a long time, megadeth has been giving us albums with strong material and memorable performances from the members that guided it with their chosen instruments. but super collider is an album made for the radio masses and doesn't succeed in the way it should have. the opener ""kingmaker"" is admittedly a strong opener, but it doesn't leave a good impression for what's to follow. every song that comes after it displays experimentation and careful crafting, but it's hard to believe in the product, especially if this isn't exactly what the fans have been craving for since their last thrash album (and that depends on who you ask on what their last masterpiece was in their eyes). sure, there are some solid moments to be found in certain instances and what dave choses to sing about may come across as heartfelt and genuine, but is it enough to convince the listener that this is truly megadeth at its finest? absolutely not. this is the worst record to be released from the band's history. the hired guns (as in chris broderick and shawn drover) tried to ulitize their skills to the finest, but it feels like they were held back from unleashing their true potential and jr's presence lives underneath the noise, doesn't feel monstrous nor is its presence highly felt. dave is first and foremost the guy that leads the band and he chose how the album goes and how it should sound. while the production is decent, it is mixed wrong, for dave's riffs and solos should be on the left, with the lead guitarist's solos be on the right, not the other way around. to be clear, i don't mind experimentation for any album, but it has to be done right. various bands have tried out different ideas and while some work, others fail. this is clearly a case of the latter and not the former. megadeth's super collider is not a bad record, but not a good one either.

that they didn't do better on the r&b charts - never mind not having one billboard pop hot 100 cross-over - is strange when you hear their sweet harmony, and one can only conclude it had a lot to do with poor promotion of their efforts combined with some bad material. still, worth a listen and a 4 star release if it had included the b-sides of their hits (where are we supposed to find those in a quality cd?) rather than lp cuts or sides that were never previously released.

overall song reviews:

vi pner porten til helvete- starts off with a very catchy guitar riff and vocal lines. great song. it's only flaw would have to be that it lasts somewhere over six minutes and loses a bit of its flavor after a little while. (3.5/5)

frostbitten woodlands of norway- a mediocre song that is semi-original when it comes to the instrumental work. a bit more on the uninteresting side, overall. (3/5)

start up the incinerator (here comes another useless fool)- from beginning to end, this song will prove that cd definitely has some great intensity. its chorus is actually pretty catchy too. (4/5)

submit to satan!!!- another vicious song that stays true to its title. again, the guitar work proves itself worthy with some pretty fast and heavy riffs. one of cd's better songs on the album, i'd say. (4/5)

diabolism (the seed and the sower)- sounds a bit similar to previous songs, but has some pretty strong vocal lines and instrumental executions. (3.5/5)

dypfryst/dette er mitt helvete- not a big fan of this song. it sounds like it was meant to be a part of ""diabolism"", for it starts right after ""diabolism"" ends and doesn't feature any real vocal or instrumental variation. (2/5)

everyday i must suffer! - carpathian forest- has a really solid beginning. the guitar riff sounds almost like something you'd find in a hard rock song and adds a bit of an easier instrumental edge. still, though, the vocals are as ferocious as always and help to keep the brutality heard in previous songs. it also stays away from lasting too long, finishing just a little over 4 minutes, and leaving your ears in a state of pure shock and your body rushing with adrenaline. i really like song. again, probably one of the better songs on the album. (4/5)

first cut is the deepest- definitely not one of cd's better songs. the drum work is ridiculous, and sounds like someone is just blindly pounding away. overall, the song is pretty boring too. (2/5)

everybody egocentericat existencialism- begins with a lighter sound than all of the other songs. still, though, it picks up, just when your ears think they are being cut a break, with some pretty good guitar riffs and heavy vocals. it could use a bit more excitement though. not the best song on the lp, but not the worst. (3/5)

shut up, there is no excuse to live...- individually, a pretty good song...but comparatively doesn't differ too much from the other songs. it does, however, start to pick up a bit about 3 minutes in. nevertheless, it isn't anything to rant about. (3/5)

overall, this lp wasn't horrible...but could use a bit of fine tuning. like any album it has its high-points, such as its catchy black metal vocal choruses and the display of some great instrumental techniques. it also has its negative points, though...such as, having songs that are pretty tedious to sit through and a bit too long for their own good. nonetheless, i'd suggest this to die-hard black metal fans and newer fans to the music genre alike...or to anyone who is looking for a pretty chaotic album to listen to, for that matter- if that is they can look past this lp's few flaws.",Interesting take on black metal...but needs a bit of work.,1182297600,2.0,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1054

let me clarify, the production values of this album are at there highest for a veil album. the cleans also don't ruin it for me, like so many upset fans proclaimed. the guitar work is fluid, drums crisp and vocals easily understood in the mix.

my issues with matriarch start and end with the songs themselves from a writing stand point. yes we get some of the thrashy parts still, we get some of the melody and the usual progression we've become accustomed to. however the frantic written melodies and pace seems to have been eschewed in favor of a slower pace. something that resembles their touring peers periphery in many ways. they've slowed things down, but not always showcasing the same scope of grandiose riff's and drumming the album quickly becomes stale.

there's an otherwise wonderful song that is about beating up meek people. when do ""the meek"" ever do anything that requires ""turning the other cheek""? all they had to do was change ""meek"" to ""creep(s)"" and you'd have a song that's very relevant. still a good track, but it requires some emotional gymnastics when that line comes around. then there's another where it sounds like he's going to kill someone for disrespecting him, or something. usually swearing doesn't bother me, but i'd be way uncomfortable playing this particular track too loud in the violent context it's used. i don't know...i guess the album will be popular with inmates. in fact, the previous song is called ""my long walk to jail"". hmm, felon rock?
filter has also taken some other wrong turns. they're embracing ""skater culture"" in a way that seems too overt now. there's also too much adversely-processed vocals, growling, and screaming that sounds like disturbed and all those other crummy psychotically-hard rock groups out there. don't get me wrong; patrick can sound very good screaming, but much of it on here sounds like they're trying to do it in a more marketable way. maybe they've just been listening to commercial radio too much and it's not a conscious choice. then, we've got the end of the album which seems intended for sitting around a ceremonial camp fire and tripping on mescaline. it's extremely interesting, but difficult to pay attention to for the length of the entire track.
all this said, however, there are some great tracks on here. where do we go from here is soaring and supremely relevant. columind is fitting for the subject matter, though it sounds like a completely different band and the non-chorus vocals seem like sort of a waste of patrick's voice. the song that's grown on me the most is the only way (is the wrong way). for just a moment, he even sounds like wayne coyne from the flaming lips, which i think is pretty cool. i'll still listen to this album a lot, but it will be with me at times psyching myself into hearing something slightly different than is actually there.

the problem with this release is that i don't see any transcendent work art here. i think that ""dark saga"" was better, even more open and sincere. in this release everything sounds in some way familiar, and the intended atmosphere never caught me. i could even tolerate the kitschy themes, but what i couldn't really stand was the monotonic sound along the entire album.
so, i guess that three stars is a fair score: this is not a bad album, but it'll pass by -at least for me. i'll be looking forward to hearing more from this band. 'till then!","Fair, but rather flat and repetitive, in spite of Barlow.",1001462400,,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1075

this south pacific recording reunites dame kiri te kanawa and jose carreras, fresh from bernstein's dg recording of his own west side story. dame kiri may not be as sassy and spunky a nellie as mary martin of the original broadway cast, and her version of ""i'm gonna wash that man..."" does seem a little staid. but at least she gives us winning renditions of ""a cockeyed optimist"" and ""a wonderful guy"", and an especially campy version of the wholesome comic mumber ""honey bun,"" complete with the first recording of the choral refrain. jose carreras, on the other hand, is an exceptionally superb emile, singing his solos with character, feeling and an operatic fervour. after all, the role was created for a full-throated opera singer, ezio pinza, and carreras admirably copes with the demands of the role. his versions of ""some enchanted evening"" and ""this nearly was mine"" are appropriately ravishing and romantic. the only miscast role is that of bloody mary, because of the jazz stylings that sarah vaughan brings to her two songs, but at least she understands the mood of the songs when she translates them into her performance. but mandy patkin, the only true broadway singer in this recording, delivers an insightful and confident portrayal of lietunant cable, perhaps even more condescending than william tabbert. patkin fleshes out the two sides of cable's character, with a hard-hitting version of ""carefully taught"" and a tender, heartfelt and ravishing ""younger than springtime"" that i consider the best and definitive rendition of the song ever on disc. the other roles are decently and competently played, but somehow the sailors lack humour and come off too straight-laced. this is especially true of their stiff rendition of ""there is nothing like a dame.""
but enough of the characters of the cast, and on to the way this recording is presented. as i have said before, the digital recording is atmospheric, sumptuous and clear. this recording is also more comprehensive than the original broadway cast version. the overture is heard complete, save for a minor cut, and you also get to hear a complete version of ""this nearly was mine"", and a gorgeous version of the rarely-heard entr'acte. i am fond of the fact that this recording adopts the ""some enchanted evening"" finale, as it gives a more musically-satisfying end to the story as told by the score. the only quibbles i have revolve around the two cut songs, loneliness of evening, and my girl back home. they could have possibly been recorded as appendixes for this recording, and made it feel more comprehensive.
on the whole, while this recording is not necessarily a good recording of south pacific, at least it gives some credible performances from kiri and carreras, and presents the score in well-recorded digital sound. i myself wouldn't want to part with the mary martin recording, but at least this recording is not as abominable as some people think it is.",SOUTH PACIFIC in a hit-and-miss curate's egg,1074211200,7.0,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1076

however, for all their plus points, i find that decapitated lack a serious amount of character. like so many other death metal bands out there, they concentrate too much on being as heavy and tight as possible that there's simply no room for the music to breathe. making music isn't about filling a checklist of what qualities your band should have, but i sometimes get the feeling that's what decapitated do - they've got the skill, they've play tightly together and they're not afraid to make it fast and heavy. but the music has no soul. great death metal bands have a dark feel to them, a burst of energy, and at times a heavy groove. cryptopsy have that. immolation have that. suffocation had that before they broke up. hell, even brujeria have that and they're not even a real band. these young gentlemen don't have that. no matter how tight, heavy or fast this album gets, it never excites me. it just sounds like death metal by numbers. decent death metal by numbers, but death metal by numbers none the less.

the musicianship is damn near flawless without a doubt, but unless you listen to death metal pretty much exclusively (or at least, alongside other extreme metal sub-genres), i wouldn't recommend this album. with that said, i've heard good things about their other albums and some bad things about this, so i'll listen to their other stuff before i forget about them.","A frightenly talented death metal band, but....",1096848000,5.0,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1080

by looking at many of the artists on here, it might make some people want to leave the album in the store. there are a lot of unimpressive joints, like the 1995 sound of mack 10 and da hood's ""balla"" and czarnok's corny rhymes on ""beauty queen"". and fabolous falls victim to yet another mase comparison with the trite ""no need for conversation"", mainly because the music doesn't sound much different from ""breathe, stretch, shake"".

chingy sounds wack as usual on the wrongfully titled ""professional"", but the thing is that he still sounds better than his accompanying crew, g.i.b. (the get it boys). speaking of wack crews, the st. lunatics also appear on this album (sans nelly) to deliver ""time"", and the third verse contains one of the weakest similes i have ever heard: ""i'm on point like a guard"". another lyrical faux pas is when red caf says his style is ""butter like parkay"" on ""all night long"". parkay is margarine, not butter.

trey songz also sounds misguided on the bling-blingin' style of ""about da game""; i really think he should stick to ballads. there's also the odd pairing of the game and lil scrappy on ""southside"", and scrappy's not even rapping; he's just talking at the end of the song, but game doesn't exactly save the song, either. and twista and faith evans' obligatory we-are-the-world song ""hope"" doesn't help or hurt the album.

all these shortcomings make it hard to enjoy good songs like van hunt's ""your love (is the greatest drug i've ever known)"". and although i'm not sure who letoya or ak'sent are, the ladies do a good job singing and rhyming on ""what love can do"" and ""this one"", respectively, making me look forward to when they release albums (the liner notes state that all the featured artists' albums would be coming out before the end of 2005, but most of them didn't). and that's not really a horrible thing in the end. don't think twice about picking up the movie coach carter, but let the soundtrack be.

the problem?  we have been getting remixes from the band over and over for too many years when they don't feel like working for a year or two, and the activity on a lot of their websites is getting low.  considering the marital and population explosion of the bandmembers--with the exception of andrea--i hate to agree with a reviewer who observed last year on their home album that atlantic seems to be grooming andrea for a solo career.  at first i was angry with his assessment, but now it seems that way.  if the band really wants to satisfy long-term fans and spend more time at home with their families, (i have been suggesting this to a few of their websites) they ought to release a celtic/pop christmas album that will allow them to get more acceptable airplay here in the states and will only have to make random promo appearances worldwide for two months--a win/win situation.

one thing is certain; 30stm have seemingly used every moment of those four and a half years to create this album.  it's epic.  it's full of anthems.  it's just...big.  it's clear that the band intended ""this is war"" to be their magnum opus, their statement.

but does the album actually, you know, work?

well, yes and no.

30 seconds to mars certainly accomplished their goal of making an epic.  song after song leaps out of the speakers and into the skies.  there are soaring melodies, booming drums, pulsing synths, walls of guitars and armies of voices.

but that's also the album's main problem.

the same elements are used on essentially every song.  the sound is exciting at first but quickly grows repetitive.  a few epic tracks sprinkled throughout an album add fire and greatness, but if an album is made up of epic track after epic track after epic track it grows monotonous.  that's exactly what happens here.

and, to be honest, it's extremely frustrating because many of the songs here are excellent.  it's the presentation that is the problem, not the songs themselves.  'night of the hunter' is sexy and driving. 'stranger in a strange land' is extremely musically interesting. 'kings and queens', 'vox populi', 'hurricane', 'alibi'...there's just a lot of strong material here.  sure there are a few duds, but for the most part the songs easily hold up.  there's no denying leto can effortlessly pump out songs that are just flat-out catchy.  a lot of tracks here will have listeners reaching for the repeat button.  also, leto's still got a great voice.  he can croon, he can scream, he can belt it out with crystal clarity.  whether or not you believe what he's singing, you can tell he sure believes it.

but in the end the production and presention keep the album from being truly great.  it's all just too overblown and calculated.  there's no spontaneity here.  the songs never get a chance to breathe.  the songs didn't need choirs, they didn't need six minute run times, they didn't need to follow essentially the same forumla throughout the length of the album.  all they needed was to be allowed to exist on their own instead of processed within an inch of their life.  the band was so busy consciously trying to create an ""epic"" that they forgot to make a living, breathing album.  all the parts are there, but ""this is war"" has no soul.  at its center there is only a pumping piston, not a beating heart.","In A War, Someone Always Loses",1260230400,32.0,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1089

cons: most of the tracks on this last volume blow.

this cd is the last of the amazing classic disney cd series. the series ran from the first release of september 12, 1995, for three years of slowly released cds, with the last one getting its outing on september 22, 1998, almost three years to the day of the first release.
 i have made many a disney cd-r compilation for long car trips and especially for driving our rented car in orlando, florida.
 if you haven't guessed, my family and i are disney nuts. we travel down to orlando at least once a year, more often than not twice. these cds provide that extra disney magic that does not have to stop just because you left the theme parks or resort area. pop one of these volumes in you cd player in the car, and the magic continues.

i'll make a man out of you from mulan has always been a favorite of the family's. the fact that escaped us at first is that donny osmond provides the lead vocal for this song. it makes it a bit more interesting to me, because although being an american i have no way of escaping the fact that donny osmond exists and is a big part of american pop culture, i haven't really heard any donny osmond music until this song. it was a bit surprising at first that donny osmond sings so well. i don't know what i expected, but it dispenses some of my respect in his direction.
 my family and i were in disney world at the end of one spring, and we met donny osmond who was hanging out in tomorrow land, in the magic kingdom theme park while we were there. he was performing at disney for some floridian school thing, i'm not sure what it was, but i remember that they closed the parks early that night for this big event.
 anyway, in the day he was just hanging out with his son in the parks. my wife and i were trying to get our son to smile for this novelty picture, and only donny osmond was able to get him to smile.
 since donny osmond has been affiliated with disney for so long, it was extra disney magical to meet him on that hot day.
strange things from the movie toy story is terrific like all the songs from this movie. written and performed by randy newman in a style that cannot be duplicated. his performance of the songs from toy story is historical as it is the first time a disney music contributor has performed his own songs for the movie. he portrays the voice of woody in song perfectly here.
seize the day is a good song from a movie that i have never seen. it is a song that reminds me of a broadway show. although, i wouldn't include this song on a disney cd-r, if i were to be listening to this cd, i wouldn't fast forward it. in fact, it makes me curious about the movie, maybe i'll rent it someday.
the rain rain rain came down down down from winnie the pooh is just short enough at under two minutes, that makes this song enjoyable. i have never seen this movie, but pooh and friends are so familiar that it doesn't matter that no vivid imagery exists in my head.
yo ho (a pirates life for me) has been on other disney compilations released by disney before, but this version is a bit special and unique. the version on other disney compilations has edited versions included. it only makes sense since the song has only one part that repeats over and over. so, although this is not the full version, it is still longer at almost 5 minutes. it includes area music from the disney attraction that takes up the first 2? minutes of this track.
my own home is a beautiful ballad from the jungle book. it has such a soothing melody and tone, plus the touch of ethnicity adds a touch of authenticity. it's important to make these songs believable, and this song hits the mark without a hitch.
i've got no strings from pinocchio is very enjoyable. this is one of my favorite scenes in this movie, where pinocchio is forced to perform as the main attraction. dickey jones, who provided the voice for pinocchio also sings the songs, and he does a great job here.

 this cd is definitely the worst out of this bunch. it almost feels like they scraped the bottom of the allotted barrel of songs to make this cd. it doesn't make sense to me why disney records would be allowed only a certain number of songs, when there are so many songs to choose from. why would they be able to release songs from toy story but not from toy story 2 which was released before this series was completed. who knows, plus it's only a theory put forth by me. it seems to hold up though, because although this series ended, a new series called disney's greatest volumes 1 - 3 with all of the same songs were released just a year or two later.

this is a lot to try to absorb in one listen.  on the first disc, the songs average 4-5 minutes in length, and there are 13 tracks on it.  the second disc, which contains 12 tracks, has songs that range between 3-4 minutes in length.  while the first disc may have longer songs, it's actually the easier disc to listen to.  the second disc focuses too much on midtempo and slow songs, which can make it a tedious listen.

  nevermind was the first bubblegum/hardcore fusion and it worked in the bands favour. smells like teen spirit is a hit. the work is done. marry a rock-star wife, take up junk, blast yourself, become immortalised in rock history. god bless cobains family, it's a tragedy he got so caught up in success. when thinking about these things, it's a good idea to listen to the smiths song 'paint a vulgar picture'... gee i've lost my point.... next paragraph.

  so q magazine readers voted this the greatest album of all time back in january 2003. balderdash. pure and utter balderdash. cobain had a decent melody or two, but he was no poet. the lyrics are but shallow, meaningless couplts knocked off so he'd have something to sing that sounded 'depthful' and 'artistic'. in reality they're random words that sound good together. i think, deep down, cobain may have been lying when he wrote 'i'd rather be dead than cool' in 'stay away'. if you want a top-class cobain work, richer lyrically and musically, get in utero. nevermind is a stepping stone. a man of great talent on the road to artistic maturity. there was something in the way alright, but soon he blew it out of his way and went on to write accomplished works like 'scentless apprentice', 'very ape' and 'serve the servants'.

  i am not, i repeat, not saying nevermind is a bad album. it's an above-average early nineties classic. it's better than most in its league. it beats a lot of its derivatives, though nirvana came nowhere near the wipers in terms of pure mastery of craft. greg sage was the man behind the genius of the wipers and if you want great pop-punk buy the first three wipers albums, three complete masterpieces, available in one box-set. so, if you don't own nevermind, buy it, forget about the myth and just enjoy it's simplicity and pop-appeal. eventually you'll get tired of it, then you can buy in utero, which you won't ever tire of, if you're like me. overall, nevermind makes quite a soundtrack to adolescence. i don't listen to bands like nirvana much nowadays, but they were very important, so respect them for now, and you may soon love them.","Some polish, teen angst, sexual frustration, punk ideals and a cool frontman.",1122940800,,,,CDs,a1124

after forever is a symphonic, gothic metal, beauty and beast band from the netherlands. they are a sextet but they also use guest musicians and singers to fill out their sound so it resembles a symphonic orchestra for a sound like many other popular european metal bands like fellow countrymen within temptation and norwegian band sirenia and not unlike nightwish and therion..

invisible circles

invisible circles is based on a story about a girl, who was born unwanted by her father, growing up in a loveless home. the girl learns at an early age, that she is unloved and throughout the album between the music are little suites of the parents talking and arguing. there are occasional growling vocals, which is supposed to be the girl's inner self talking to her consciousness.

probably the most notable member of the band is their highly acclaimed singer, floor jansen and even she seems to be struggling on this album, as her usually flawless voice seems both stretched and strident. the music is still symphonic metal with a backing orchestra and choir as in previous releases. what has changed is the bands approach. instead of the conventional medieval beauty and beast approach of their past the song writers have decided to veer off into a more contemporary, avant garde style. while i applaud their initiative and intent to create an operatic masterpiece, it seems they only succeeded in the creation of a soap opera.

while i'm usually taken with concept albums, invisible circles is an exception. in fact, for me, invisible circles was one of my larger musical disappointments of 2004. after forever's previous 2001 full album, decipher was truly a remarkable recording and i was so looking forward to more of the same but alas, they decided to thread a new path. what path is that? i'm afraid they got lost and found the path of uninteresting music. there are to few hooks, at least nothing that hooks my attention and the melodies are closer to odious than melodious. even the concept is uninteresting, being about the trials and tribulations of an unwanted little girl growing up in an unhappy family. i can see why mark jansen left and formed epica after listening to this and exordium, their preceding lackluster ep released in 2003. he obviously was not in agreement with the band's new musical path.

i usually find floor jansen's voice to be perfect but for some unknown reason, on this album, i found her voice was grating, almost irritating, like she was too strident or something. now floor has one of the purest, most beautiful voices in the world but she seemed to be struggling at times with these songs.

i should point out that this album has received some rave reviews. god knows why but it seems there's always someone somewhere that will like something i dislike and vice versa, however, it's usually the other way around with me. when i and most other people are enthralled with a certain album, somebody will come along and rain on our parade. well this time it's moi who is precipitating the precipitation. not that this is a bad album, it's just a dull album, there`s nothing special.. no real highlights or highpoints and while a song may get interesting occasionally they manage to blow it before the song ends. in the past, after forever has been one of the leading symphonic beauty and beast bands and though they still show some symphonic elements, they're now leaning in a more progressive direction. there is nothing wrong with that but they're half way there and what we have is not the best of either genre and where they retain some of the old sound, they fail to close the deal. give me back my ""leaden legacy"", ""monolith of doubt"", ""pledge of allegiance"", ""the key"", ""follow the cry"" and ""forlorn hope"". honestly, i can think of very little that appeals to me on this album.

the leads in  this revival are okay, but their voices lack the full, almost operatic  quality that drake and morrison had; where drake and morrison could fill  the hall with their high notes in ""where is the life that late i  led?"" and ""i hate men,"" these new leads, brian stokes  mitchell and marin mazzie, lack depth and color in their voices and  virtually yell some of their lyrics, leaving the impression that maybe they  just can't hit the high notes, or, god forbid, think yelling enhances the  delivery of the lyric.
and no one -- and not amy spanger or michael  berresse -- will ever equal lisa kirk's coy yet sophisticated sassiness on  ""always true to you darling in my fashion,"" or harold lang's mel  torme-like foggy whiskey voice on ""bianca.""
further, the  ""new"" lyrics not in the original version of ""fashion,""  sound made up and not cole porter-urbane enough to have been part of the  original song; maybe they were, but, if so my apologies to the peru  (indiana) poet.  the only song that may be better on the revival album is  ""brush up your shakespeare."" the instrumental background on the  revival album is okay enough, especially as they tried to stay true to the  original scoring, and with new technology, you can hear it better, but the  show just lacks something.
it lacks the aura of post world war ii new  york city and broadway sophistication that cole porter, writing these songs  on his piano in his central park penthouse, and drake and morrison, giant  figures of the flourishing b'way stage then, conveyed in the original;  in  the late forties and early fifties, they pushed the envelope with lyrics  and delivery that then -- and now -- conveyed a more mature, jaded, weary  worldliness than the current crop of fresh-faced youngsters on the revival  album is able to convey.  the double entendres and word play (harris  pat/paris hat) could only be cole porter; only gypsy and les mis contain  anything remotely as deliciously clever.  the delivery of these lines on  the original conveyed the singers' appreciation for the true wit of what  they were singing; the revivalists seem not to get the jokes, or, if they  do, think them all that funny.
i miss the almost symphonic overture and  entr'acte which were on the original album but were omitted from the  revival, and find the spoken intros to songs sometimes annoying, although  they help put the songs in more context.
our broadway musical heritage  has provided a canon of shows which should regularly be trotted out, the  way the met trots out its operatic canon; there should be a broadway  equivalent to the met dedicated to the preservation and presentation of  these shows.
""kate"" is part of that broadway canon, and i  give credit to this revival for letting us see it again.  however,  subsequent shows -- and this is one -- tend not to measure up to the  originals in our eyes and ears -- ""guys and dolls"" and in some  ways, ""cabaret"" being two of the few exceptions --  because the  original version of a memorable show song provides the true, authoritative  template stamped in our mind, and thereafter, the only one we want to hear.  at the risk of sounding like an old fogie (i consider myself a young one),  that prejudice colors my reaction to this revival of ""kate.""  it  is good, but not great, while the original was truly great, the stuff of  legend --  brush up on it, why don't you.","Where is the ""Kate"" that early I heard?",953337600,22.0,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1129

sound: well they've randomly introduced a thrash-like sound, but it doesn't even sound that thrashy, just aggressive hardcore stuff. but then they mix it with the keyboard, which makes the whole sound cheesy. the combined sound does not work well at all. it's like they've cut and paste two different songs together.
vocals: alexi's death growls aren't too bad, but they're a bit too ""screamy."" in a lot of the chorus though, he sings (badly), again making the whole song cheesy. i'd prefer him not to sing, than what he's attempting to do.
lyrics: not very good. i've never cared too much for lyrics in melodic death metal music (the wonderful music makes up for it), but this is absurd. go read the lyrics for ""in your face"" for example.

good songs:
""trashed, lost & strung out"" - the best song on the cd. the thrash-like sound actually sound like thrash, and it combines well with the melody. it sounds like an old time cob song and has a cool solo
""we're not gonna fall"" - another old sounding cob song. it has a catchy chorus and a good keyboard/guitar solo.
""living dead beat"" - i love the introduction, and the consistent tune with the duel-guitar effect. i don't like the chorus very much, but the singing can't be helped. there is a 1min 15-second solo, which starts off with the guitar leading, then the keyboards.
""somebody put something in my drink"" - a pretty hilarious cover of the ramones song. but the `happiness' of the song seems out of place on this album.

okay songs:
""are you dead yet"" - for being the title track, it's a little disappointing. although the solo isn't too bad, the rest of the song is filled with repetitive chords and an annoying chorus.
""[...] of bodom"" - the melody is good in this song, but then combined with the metalcore riffs spoils the song a bit.
""next in line"" - quite a forgettable song. the music is quite good this time, but the screaming and ridiculous chorus is irritating. however the keyboard solo is high quality.

bad songs: (by bad i mean not so good for bodom)
""in your face"" - second single and i must comment how awful it is. with atrocious childish lyrics, this song puts cob to shame. sure it's heavy, but with this song the mix of hardcore and neo-classical fits together like two broken jigsaw pieces. one minute he's screaming to the same distorted riff (played three times!) then he's singing to the most retarded chorus in the album. the only good thing about this song is the drumming.
""if you want peace...prepare for war"" - the introduction doesn't even sound like cob, but wouldn't be out of place on a slipknot album. although there is some melody the ""slipknot-esque"" screams and chugging riffs dominants the whole song.
""punch me i bleed"" - the slow approach to this song is just silly. the chugging music is the verse is impractical, and the music to the chorus sounds like heavy power ballad music. i'm not sure what on earth he means by ""i play the radio in everyway.""

it's not worth buying the imported cd for the two bonus tracks. i haven't heard ""talk dirty to me"" but i have heard ""oops i did it again"" and...it's not very good. it's still a very good album, but not brilliant, like previous cob albums. although there is quite a bit of melody, the metalcore sound combined makes the songs sound more mainstream and less like the godly gothenburg sound. the songs are watered down in complexity and song structure, as well as the lyrics and solos. like anders frid?n (in flames vocalist), alexi laiho sings in the choruses, but he's not that impressive

and for the only time in their recording career, their songwriting suffers from it all too. maybe it was the pressure of filling the whole of the previous disc (a hard day's night) with all original tunes, but here the lennon-mccartney team fell back into the formula of the band's first two discs-- 8 original compositions alongside 6 cover songs.
the band do manage to keep focused on the direction they were taking their sound, and the use of acoustic guitars and folky arrangements lace tracks such as no reply, i don't want to spoil the party and the dylan-inspired i'm a loser.

""don't forget 'em"", ""who knew my luck would change"", ""job song"", ""grammy family"", and ""the good the bad the ugly"" are all tracks worth hearing.  the trick is staying put long enough to get to these songs.  i'll give him this much, he can ride beats very well.  no matter how they sound.  a lot of rappers today seem to have trouble with that.

as far as flaws go, there are a few joints that fell under skip material for me -- ""pretty little sexy mama"", ""disperse"" (i forget the sample used here, but cru used it on ""just another case"" much better), ""uncle rahiem"", ""callin' me"" and quite a few others.  like most have already mentioned, ""feel this way"" sounds more like a john legend song featuring 'quence and ""night night"" is mad corny.  another beef i have with this lp, and most albums that kanye releases, are the excessive, uneccesary, and stupid skits.  they're wack.  also, the album begins to unravel somewhere toward the middle of it.  you will find most of the skip material there.

don't quit your day job is a decent release.  it's weighed down by the amount of skip material, but the good songs are really good.  it's not the worst thing you've ever heard, but it won't blow you away either.  i just expected more from someone that's been doing this for over 10 years.  i have to recommend buying this one used.

""satellite rides"" was one fantastic ride and while i do understand that bands take new directions with sounds (and often rediscover their roots), this new album provides more of less than what i expected.

 this album was recorded under 8-track direction with more of a live and less of a polished sheen. admirably on paper, this could work. however, this album does not showcase the incredible energy and strong song sets that their previous releases boasted.

 the opener, ""won't be home"" is my favorite track on the album and is one of the strongest tracks on the collection. listen to the ""trademark"" country inflection tinged with rhett's highly-earnest delivery. the vocals are upfront, the music / melody bounces along and the lyrics bittersweet and clever without being clever-clever.

 from that point, i was expecting to hear this type of quality through the rest, but the disc lags halfway with such outtake-sounding, semi-fleshed out songs as ""smokers"" and ""coahuila"". even the ""stock"" country songs such as ""blinding sheets of rain"", ""borrowed bride"", and ""bloomington"" lack any real sound-signatures that the 97s usually provide. side-by-side, ""wreck your life"" (an older and stellar lp) felt fresher and magical as each track was peppered with their texan wit, stylistic musicianship and their own defined sound. even the closing track, ""no mother"", stumbles to find the theme of loss and dirge-like tunefulness... it just seems repetitive, underdone and gloss-less.

 this is a good release that feels like a stepping stone towards things to come.

 ""lazy"", ""smoky"", enjoyably flawed... support this talent but don't expect the pop-trends of the past or the surprises found during their ""beginnings"".

 if you want this sound, but want superior tunes, check out their older releases: ""wreck your life"", ""hitchhike to rhome"" or ""early tracks...""",3.5 stars actually,1090972800,,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1150

for many fans, the rapcore was a step too far and their popularity faded. however, they were to return to form with the metallic skin for skin (2006). this was going to be their final album. yet they came back with a second final album in tsar bomba (2009), which marked the return of steve osbourne on guitar. so here we are again with their third final album in incorruptible (2013). but then, bride was always playing by a different set of rules.

the line-up here is dale thompson (vocals), troy thompson (guitars, cello, keyboards & ukulele), brad holland (bass) and jay meese (drums). the main style is heavy rock infused with blues leanings. sadly, steve osbourne committed suicide shortly after completing their last album and they hold him in their thoughts during unbelievers. it starts with an abrasive riff before settling into classic metal. here is a prayer for unbelievers / here is hope for the sinner. its holds a rollercoaster set of emotions along the way. when push comes to shove / darkness swallows love / never been a blacker night / than when we see the light.

darker days has an up-tempo approach with relentless hard rock as they let rip. shadows are illusion with painted black faces / religion is a habit that can never save us / heaven is a place very close to my heart / hell was invented to keep us tore apart. this is coupled with the thoughtful, keyboard-led darker

things slow down for more traditional rock in we lie (based on john 3:30) and a keyboard instrumental serenade. after the gentle guitar intro to all the kids are gone, they bring a slow-burning intensity to the proceedings (along with furious outburst of guitar).

there is a ballad in melting with its cello and acoustic guitar giving way to more rocky passages. i feel i am melting into this world of pain / i feel i am sinking into this world of shame / i feel i am dying / you're the one to blame / what is my purpose my future my reason to stay.

with all of these melodic passages chopping up the proceedings, the album starts to lose pace. it is not helped by throwing in the epic free at this point. it has a strong structure with plenty going for it. but this would have been better placed earlier in the track listing. even though religion picks up the tempo, it is another track that is longer than it should be and boredom sets in. this means that the slow, meandering i cant imagine sees me finally hitting the stop button and turning off.

thankfully when i come back, there is the raunchy i want it all throwing out some blistering guitar. there is hard rock blues where you want to go and the blues coupled with soulful vocals in sleep on. they close with the acoustic i choose you.

the headliners in 1999 were limp bizkit, who after being the opening act on the 1998 tour, had finally reached superstardom with two multi-platinum albums under their belts. and what better time than before their 15 minutes of fame was over for them to headline. really, the band is in top-form on here. all of the lb tracks (sans ""i would for you,"" a jane's addiction cover) draw from ""significant other,"" which still stands to date as their most successful (and in my opinion, best) album. although the song selection is a little weak, they still deliver an excellent performance. i especially enjoyed listening to ""nookie"" and ""re-arranged.""
korn are also featured on here, but not as extensively as limp bizkit, for two reasons: one, korn were not the headliners and two, korn only appeared for a few dates on the tour. that being said, however, their selection on here is great. you get a combo of ""a.d.i.d.a.s."" and ""good god"" that just sounds excellent and a nice rendition of ""falling away from me"" that only suffers from jonathan's strained vocals (i suspect he had a cold or something).
minimally featured are the crystal method and the hip-hop duo method man & redman. crystal method perform ""keep hope alive"" and it is the only track of theirs that is on here. i like crystal method, but live techno? kind of pointless. i think the cd could have benefited from more method man and redman, the latter being one of the best and most underrated mc's of the 90's. their contribution ""da rockwilder"" serves as a nice break in the otherwise alternative/nu-metal clutter.
staind give their radio-hit ""mudshovel"" a nice performance, and  frontman aaron lewis shines on the acoustic track ""outside,"" which everyone has heard by now and ended up being the song that catapulted them into fame.
primus contribute two songs ""lacquer head"" and ""my name is mud"" that are pretty enjoyable, but for the uninitiated, might be boring. they sort of stick out like a sore thumb on this tour, but give a nice performance nontheless.
finally, filter. i have nothing against filter, and the two songs they contribute are really good songs (""welcome to the fold"" and ""hey man, nice shot""), but they sound like complete cacophony on here. really, listening to them perform on this cd i get the impression that they must be the worst live band ever. these tracks will make even die-hard fans cringe.
so, overall, i think this is a pretty good live cd. once you can get past the pointless, preachy, typical fred durst rambling throughout the booklet, you'll enjoy it. but just like the other two family values cd's, it's hit or miss. if you didn't like any of the bands before, this cd won't change your mind, but if you happen to be a fan, you will find something to make you happy on here -- that is, unless you're a filter fan...",A decent little package.,1041465600,2.0,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1166

the best of the originals are ""queen for a day"" and the absolutely awesome title track. also, this release includes two covers (of songs originally by joan baez and jethro tull, respectively).

if you like this great band, you should probably get this and all their studio discs. but if you want to experience a really entertaining showcase by this unique act, go straight to the 'castles and dreams' dvd--you will not be sorry.

moving on to the solo years, why is there so little from her first solo album ""whatever"" and so much from the inferior followup ""i'm with stupid""? where are superior ""whatever"" tracks such as ""i've had it"", ""4th of july"", could've been anyone"", ""mr. harris"" or ""i know there's a word""?
so this is far from being the ultimate anything, except possibly the ultimate cash-in. that said, there are reasons to own this collection, all of them the scattered b-sides that have been larded in to entice long-term fans. if you don't already own the ""whatever"" era b-sides ""take it back"" or ""jimmy hoffa jokes"" you need them--these are brilliant songs that in a brilliantly perverse decision appeared only as bonus tracks on cd singles and promo items--and since the original sources are now hard to find, this is a convenient way to get them. silly title be damned, ""jimmy hoffa jokes"" may well rank in the top 10 mann songs of all time, and ""take it back"" is not far behind. mann's cover of badfinger's ""baby blue"" is faithful and  terrific as well. ""driving with one hand on the wheel"", which appeared as both a ""i'm with stupid"" b-side and on the ""safe and sound"" benefit compilation, is merely adequate  aimee mann (which is to say essential by the standards of lesser artists). sign of love is an insignificant pop cover that originally appeared on the ""back to the beach"" soundtrack. mann completists will want this, but everyone else can pass. and as for the aforementioned live version of ""other end (of the telescope)"", well, the less said the better.
overall, then, completists and committed fans will want this for the b-sides if they don't already have them. everyone else is directed to purchase her original solo albums in their entirety, starting with ""whatever"".
the three stars are entirely for the two brilliant original ""whatever""-era b-sides that appear here and nowhere else (nowhere else in print, that is), and for the badfinger cover.

for those of you who need the proverbial question answered ... he's a bit like the allman brothers, with thickly moist southern influences, and can kick as ethereally hard as wishbone ash, who flew so high i'm surprised that their wings never froze.  but hay, i don't need to make comparisons, this is walter's twentieth album, and that in itself should say it all.  his guitar solos are nothing short of earth shattering, breath taking, and lyrically perfect ... this is the kind of music produced by artists for whom every note matters.  but walter doesn't take to the stratosphere full time, he's a spiritual man, with spiritual needs, and like a true bluesman, always trying to find that common ground for us all to share.

after listening to it i could tell that the album came from her heart - it's like an unending letter of devotion & love to ben affleck and as i recall she got poor reviews from critics & fans about the over-indulgence of the album.  she co-wrote 9 of the 11 tracks and each speaks to how she was feeling at that time of her life which is sweet but sad given how things worked out.

simply told, this album is a tale of two halves. the album's first half is top notch. the band would dive headfirst into disco with  paul stanley's ""i was made for lovin' you"" which would not only become one of the band's biggest hits but also one of the best songs of the genre. their cover of the rolling stones' ""2000 man"" featuring vocals from frehley is easily their best cover song. the should have been second hit single ""sure know something"" is the best track here featuring great vocals from stanley and the coolest bass line that gene simmons would ever compose. peter  criss' ""dirty livin'"" is the funkiest song they'd ever record and is also a strong track. then we get to the second and much weaker half of the album. gene simmons' tunes ""x-ray eyes"" and especially ""charisma"" don't really go anywhere. stanley's ""magic touch"" isn't very good either save for the cool guitar riff. only frehley's tunes ""hard times"" and ""save your love"" are decent and they still don't touch the great tracks from the album's first half. also worth noting is that while this album is uneven, it sounds like destroyer when compared to their next album unmasked which was their weakest release. if you really love the album's first half, it's worth picking up. aside from dirty livin', the remaining strong tracks ""2000 man"" and ""sure know something"" are featured on their unplugged album and ""i was made for lovin' you"" is available on several of their best-of albums such as the very best of kiss and 20th century masters: the millenium collection.",A tale of two halves,1092355200,,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1187

sony's latest engineer andreas k. meyer has processed these recordings like they were pop, slicing off the top and bottom frequencies, then trying to use exciters to simulate the fundamentals and overtones, adding in substantial distortion at the top end.
if your ears are already blown by heavy metal, this might be for you. not me.

one thing you'll notice is that the transfers are done with the meters pegged - this cd is significantly louder than normal, as is true for the others in the series.
the distortions fatigue the ear and distract from the performance. evidently the engineer, andreas k. meyer has ears that are already fried. sony is not honest enough to list his name on the outside of the package, where we can know to avoid him.
let us hope that sony's other reissues are not similarly polluted.
unfortunately, the record business is still run by marketing men who know little about music, and this line of reissues seems designed for the racks at the mall, trading on some legendary names at minimal production cost.

as colleague russell notes, the preiser transfers are the benchmark again, their transfers done on top-of-the-line vacuum tube equipment, on generously filled cds, at full price but worth the money.

there is also the recent 10 cd warren box set on membran/intense available on amazon which covers even more recordings, including some live excerpts, all in quite acceptable, natural transfers. the cds run about one hour each and the set of 10 is sold for around $15. hard to beat.","Great performances, poor transfers",1381449600,16.0,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1190

released posthumously, 'red cross' is a significant recording to all faithful fahey fans.  a collection of seven tracks (eight if you count the brief reprise of 'red cross' buried at the end) recorded in the last months of his life that reach back and touch the previous sixty-odd years of it.

fahey meticulously picks through irving berlin's 'remember' with eerily concentrated effort.  next up, `red cross, disciple of christ today' is an example of fahey's more esoteric `modernist' compositions.  in track 3 he plays gershwin's 'summertime' with the bittersweet memories of an old man for the summertime of his life.  `ananaias' (track four) is revisits fahey's explorations up and down the musical scale.  he follows it with a quite spirited rendition of 'motherless child'.  after reading glenn jones' liner notes to 'red cross' and fahey's book of 'stories',&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/how-bluegrass-music-destroyed-my-life/dp/0965618323/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8"">how bluegrass music destroyed my life</a>, i can feel the pain and the reasoning behind the choice of this song on this final album.  jones tell us how he struggled(as i also did) to reconcile fahey the human being with the image of fahey the music-preservationist, composer, patron, and performer.

a fahey album wouldn't be complete without a train song, and track 6, `charley bradley's ten sixty-six blues' is a fine one.  `untitled with rain' (track seven) is a good example of his `wall of sonic angst' phase, if you like that sort of thing.  it mixes a heartbeat-like bass with long, funereal organ chords and fahey's atonal pluckings and inevitable environmental background sound-this time of falling rain, as if fahey called up some divine intervention to bless his work.  there's an abrupt silence for ten minutes, followed by a brief, ghostly reprise of `red cross, disciple of christ today'.

it's a sad thing he is dead.  his last gift to us may be only seven and a half songs long, but fahey's determinedly haunting finger-picking and ominous choice of compositions gives us plenty of time to listen and reflect on what truly significant contributions to music and be thankful he made them.",Fahey's Last Will and Testament,1071360000,14.0,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1205

mostly his rhymes are on point here. ""mouths to feed"" is a dope song about him working hard just to feed himself and his kids. the song ""woozy"" with r. kelly, has a nice beat (should be the second single in my opinon). the pharell williams beat ""money maker"" was something to get people dancing, as it was the lead single off of this album. the song ""tell it how it is"" couldn't have been more true in the rap industry, as he explains it's not all fun once you get inside of it saying ""...not to mention all the vultures//the scandalous promotors//crabs try to sue ya//magazines will misquote ya..."" take heed to his words in that song if you're hoping to be popular in something. also a rememerable song ""do your time"" with beanie sigel, c murder, and pimp c, as the latter three explain what they went through during their recent bids. beanie sigel pulls the better verse in the song. ""runaway love"" and ""freedom of preach"" shows how much ludacris has matured over time, and make real good songs to listen to.

also this is an improvement, there are some problems in the album. ""grew up a screw up"" luda does a good job, but young jeezy doesn't add anything to the song. ""girls gone wild"" and ""ultimate satisfaction"" with field mob are some tracks that luda doesn't impress on, and aren't worth hearing.

so overall luda has improved over time. this is one of his best albums to date, and the fact that he really suprised me on this release. unlike his other albums, ludacris shows a small introspective side, that works real well. backed by some good production and good rhymes, release therepy is an album worth picking up.

the last three releases, (murray street, sonic nurse, rather ripped) have had jim o'rourke as the drummer, and on rr he compliments the rest of the band really well. not as aggressive as some of sy earlier albums, but concise enough to make the album exactly what they all wanted it to be. the lyrics along with the music are wonderful, and the simplicity of it all in combination with the other pop elements make this a great record.

sonic youth always seems to surprise me in a few different ways every time they put something out. who would have thought they'd release something like this with the history they have in their music? i'm sure history doesn't mean much to them though, they always seem to keep on moving forward, and coming out with/pulling off these unexpected ideas. i can't wait to hear what comes next.

in case you were wondering, the springsteen influence is definitely felt in ""keep the car running"", and especially ""(antichrist television blues)"", which might as well have been written by him. they're both pretty enjoyable songs though. ""intervention"" was the lead single, and has a nice energy to it, plus some of the better interplay between win and regine. she only gets one lead part this time, and it's only part of a medley called ""black wave/bad vibrations"". but that's a good song so it's okay. the opener ""black mirror"" has an odd feel to it, but i think it's a good way to get set for the rest of what's coming. ""ocean of noise"" and ""windowsill"" are two of the weaker tracks, although they both have a couple things going for them. ""no cars go"" is a recreation of a song from their first ep, and a pretty damn catchy tune. ""my body is a cage"" ends things, and while it's not perfect, i like what it does. they were definitely trying to do something different with this album, and i respect that even if it didn't come out as great as their last effort. they're certainly one of the more likable bands playing right now.","""Working in the church while your family dies.""",1277769600,,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1239

why four stars then?

because rhino botched one album ""the dock of the bay""--it has a digital click on the 9th and 11th track. that could be forgiven if it wasn't also a problem with the ""original album series"" version of this cd as well. that's been out for some time and rhino was made aware of the problem.

these use whatever the latest remasters were and that were on the shelf. most of these received upgrades by bill inglot in the 90's but there are no credits for the individual releases here as to mastering. the box itself doesn't tout new masterings (like the america boxed set did for example) so i wouldn't expect anything new here.

it's sloppy. i expect better from rhino and so should you. here's hoping that, two months later, they get around to fixing the problem because it mars one of otis' best albums.

the individual release from the u.s. doesn't have the problem (at least mine doesn't). this was made in the eu not in the u.s. so i suspect that's where the flawed release originated from.

the rest of the albums sound pretty terrific. there aren't any bonus tracks or expanded editions here and all of these feature the mastering done by bill inglot for the individual releases.

the clam shell box is nicely designed (there will be those who hate the cover, like it, etc. but that doesn't impact the quality of the music). each individual cd comes with a replica of the label appropriate for its original release and in a cardboard sleeve replica of the original. some of the artwork could look a bit sharper with a better reproduction. the set is inexpensive though so, depending on how important the quality of the artwork is to you and the packaging, all of this may not matter.

the cardboard covers don't have the colored borders that mar the original album series releases.

like many of the clam shell boxed sets that rhino has released over the last couple of years, there isn't a booklet and the information we get on the original albums are only the info that was on the back cover of these releases. it's a pity that rhino couldn't have licensed one of the essays written for another boxed set or even an article about otis and his career for this set. yes, it might have added a bit more cost but for those discovering otis for the first time, it would be nice to have some context for the music. it's a minor flaw especially given the issue with ""dock"".

so should you buy this? well that depends. if you have the two ""original album classics"" (the eu version of this for ""dock"" has the same issue) releases which collect ten of these albums (two of these were not part of that set and they have slightly better cardboard sleeves), there's no reason to get this. if you want an instant otis collection, this is a very good but flawed set due to the sloppy manufacturing for ""dock"".

certainly mistakes occur but, since this was a problem with the previous release for ""dock""  in the smaller boxed set (it's on mine and many others) and it should have been caught before this was released.

docked (pardon the pun) a star for the flawed disc. if rhino fixes this or sends out replacement discs, i will update this review accordingly but fans are warned about the flaw now.","Nice set but there's a clicking sound that mars two tracks for the ""Dock"" album--Rhino should have fixed this by now.",1452729600,6.0,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1250

birgit nilsson is not who you'd expect as an aida. she had been singing it a lot on stage and wanted to commit her interpretation for eternity. but what can be great for the one-off kick of a night at the opera might not bear well when put directly side by side with the recorded competition. indeed the voice lacks a kind of italianate warmth, it has an almost vibrato-less kind of emission and a diamond-sharp incisiveness that is easier associated with br&uuml;nnhilde or even turandot - and try cd 1 track 25 at 0:42: what i hear there is the kind of sound like that of the ondes martenot, associated to the attack of martians in the cheap sci-fi movies of the 1950s. hard not to laugh once you've made the connection in your mind. there are a few instances also where the articulation of the words is slack in the upper reaches, but that's a detail. still, given the not insignificant proviso that nilsson doesn't sound entirely germane to the verdian vocal color and technique (and nilsson recognized that - but after all it can be accepted that ethiopians don't sing like egyptians) and, especially in the final duet with corelli, lacks the kind of innocence that would make it truly moving, her voice is impressive, with a purity i can associate with aida, and it gloriously soars over the texture in the great ensembles of the first and second act. i've read comments here and there that in the role nilsson was somewhat ""placid"" and inexpressive. not at all. just try her ""pieta, pieta"", cd 2 track 6 at 3:54: with singing as expressive, you don't need to see any acting, it's all in the voice. and isn't that passage, when aida begs her father not to disown her, strikingly reminiscent of sieglinde-wotan?

you can say that corelli is well suited to nilsson - he too has a razor-sharp emission, that could drill through the walls of the great giza pyramid. not that he is incapable of dynamic nuance, and at the end of ""celeste aida"" for instance he attacks his finale b-flat fortissimo, but manages to diminish it to the pp indicated in the score - most tenors take it all forte. but the voice is rather monochromatic, lacking the softer and warmer shades of a bj&ouml;rling or a bergonzi, better in valiance than tenderness. the nilsson-corelli duet would be in fact ideal for turandot-calaf i think (and they recorded it together of course,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/puccini-turandot/dp/b000002se0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8"">puccini: turandot</a>). and, of course, you have to accept that this radames has a strong lisp (bergonzi dit too, but less pronounced,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/verdi-aida/dp/b000klrukc/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8"">verdi: aida</a>). maybe that's why they all pine for him. `hey, honey, wanna read my lisp?"" absurdly, corelli doesn't sing the beginning his counter-melody at the end of his final duet with amneris in act iv, cd 2 track 12 at 6:12 (""immense joy...""), singing only at 6:22 the now senseless end of the phrase (""...the heart will have"" - in fact i'm not sure what he sings there are the written words; i hear him sing not ""il cor avra"" but ""si compira"", the end of amneris' phrase, [""my revenge] will be carried through"", which makes even less sense). nilsson also doesn't sing her own final accompanying phrase, ""a noi si schiude il ciel / the sky opens for us"" in the tomb duet with radames, cd 2 track 18 at 2:14. probably didn't want to steal the show from corelli. verdi happens to have judged otherwise.

i'm not convinced by the adequacy of bumbry's vocal color to the character and demands of amneris. for the premiere in cairo verdi insisted on having a true mezzo-soprano (ultimately he didn't get it) and bumbry isn't. you can almost fancy that she could sing the part of aida, the voice isn't dark and burnished enough, and the contrast with aida not pronounced enough (it may be simplistic, but it is effective, the usual quartet, soprano-tenor-mezzo-baritone, you have it in carmen, you have it in lohengrin, you have it everywhere). i wouldn't matter if her characterization brought something revelatory about the role, but i don't hear anything here either that is out of the ordinary - which doesn't mean it's bad, only that there is nothing outstanding and revelatory about it. i even find her final imprecation against the priests a bit placid and lacking fury (cd 2 track 15), and i also hear cases of breath intakes that show poor understanding of italian syntax and of what exactly she is singing (like cd 1 track 16 at 0:19, ""the mourning that bears on your [] heart with you i share"" - no way, if you need to breathe in, it is after ""heart"", not before). and her ""moooooo-rire!"", cd 2 track 12 at 2:11, accenting the first syllable of ""morire"" rather than the second, is atrocious (sure, an ""o"" is easier to sing than an ""i"", but shortly after, at 3:29, corelli does sing his high b on ""ch'io vi-va"", not ""ch'ioooooo viva"": it can be done).

the comprimari are fine, including the outstanding amonasro of mario sereni (to be outstanding an amonasro needs to have both the lyricism of ""rivedrai le foreste imbalsamate"" and the violence of ""su, dunque! sorgete egizie coorti""). as is sometimes the case, it is ramfis (bonaldo giaotti) who is cast as a basso profundo rather than, as asked for by verdi, the pharaoh (ferrucio mazzoli), which may be clever since, all told, ramfis is a more interesting and developed part. the chorus is fine too, more valiant than refined which is not out-of-character, maybe a bit undernourished for the men's religious choruses to be as atmospheric as they can (as at the beginning of the act i finale, cd 1 track 10 at 0:37 and all those ""we invoke thee, all-mighty ftah"" of act i"").

mehta had made something of a specialty of aida in montreal, florence and elsewhere in the 1960s. his conducting is no-nonsense, but somewhat prosaic at times i find. in his favor i hold that he usually moves forward with fine dramatic flair, and is usually fairly observant of the score's metronome marks, with few of the idiosyncrasies (e.g. very deliberate, to the point of dangerously verging on the plodding sometimes) of a karajan, at least as regards tempo choices. in a way this is the ""student's version"" of aida: it will give the listener a good idea of what verdi had in mind while composing it. when mehta strays, it is usually for the better. as everybody else he lingers a little too much in the amneris recitatives at the beginning of act i (cd 1 tracks 5 & 6), the opening ladies' chorus of act ii sounds more like a session of aerobics with jane fonda than like lusciously singing about the return for love of the victorious warrior, and some of his dynamics are bizarre, as cd 1 track 16 at 2:37, where he has the violins play forte and very assertively: verdi marks them piano. the trumpets of the triumphal march are piercing as corelli's voice. the various spatialisation effects, chorus, priests and priestesses singing from afar, are well done.

the recording dates from 1967, and the sound is excellent. thanks to mehta's fastish tempos the music is ideally dispatched on the two cds, with acts i & ii on cd 1 and iii & iv on cd 2, and the cueing is abundant. these voices are certainly impressive, and for a night at the opera, this would have been a terrific evening. but in the more competitive field of recordings, where one has the choice of five or ten simultaneous terrific nights at the opera, there is too much with these three principals that is not ideally suited to the roles to make this a version of reference. it is a more version for nilsson's aida, corelli's radames or bumbry's amneris than for verdi's aida.",There is too much with the three principals that is less than ideally suited to the roles to make this a top-drawer Aida,1348444800,2.0,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1257

well, in comes metal producer andy sneap and a fresh set of 10 tracks, and suddenly we have saxon producing their finest record since lionheart.  the riffs are fantastic, the choruses are soaring and catchy, and the writing in general is just very strong.  the instrumentation is also fantastic.  the guitars are fresh sounding, the solos are unique and the drums are absolutely thundering, but not overdone where they take over the mix.  i'm convinced that if you put a song like warriors of the road on us rock radio and didn't say what band it was, it would catch on.  this stuff is so much better than the generic drivel i tend to hear on the fm dial.

(benoit david doesn't disappoint with his performance here as anderson's stand-in. he has a warmth and passion that is sometimes missing in other recent yes releases) the truth is that all yes albums are good to one extent or the other as long as one listens to them in their own context.

fly from here is a phenomenal listen from beginning to end, the best track being fly from here pt. 2: sad night at the airfield. that track alone should be enough for any yes fan to want to own this album. it is classic yes in every sense. oh, and it's also accessible. the entire title track is good from start to finish. here they wisely divided it into sections instead of laying it out as one long suite a la 70's style. that gives detractors of overly long songs a chance to pick and choose which tracks to listen to. i listen to the whole thing, and if it had been made a one-piece suite, it would clock in at around 23:44 minutes. if you want long tracks, then listen all the way through. the rest of the album is not as good, but still well above average yes fare. i would include this album in my top five favorite yes albums, depending on what mood i'm in. hour of need is the low mark on the album but is still average yes. another standout track is into the storm, with its complex time signatures and catchy motifs. if the band would've stuck to this kind of songwriting instead of trying to replicate the success of 90125 in the 80's and 90's we would've had a much more solid legacy from this great band. it's not that i don't like 90125, i do. it's definitely a trevor rabin dominated album, with the unmistakable contributions from the rest of the band elevating his songs to art-pop/rock. the problem is that the albums after that seemed to lack the freshness and inspiration of 90125. this album has that freshness and inspiration and is not an art-pop/rock album. it's progressive rock with restraint and taste. i've been listening for over a month and i'm still enjoying this.

the production is also restrained and tasteful. the instruments have never been more clearly imaged and the mix is balanced with minimal sound effects and just the right amount of polish. the cover is appropriately in the vein of classic yes albums from the 70's and was done by roger dean, the same artist.

highly recommended for yes fans and fans of progressive rock. it's as good a place as any to start a yes collection.",Best Effort Since 90125,1313020800,3.0,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1275

the selection of gr themes is not bad, though i'm in the set of people that would prefer more diversity, mostly in the cd two, where all the pieces after the ""the silence"" have the same ""taste"". anyway, i like them all, and i think that mostly for power metal fans the entire album is a must-have. if you feel some nostalgy for the old helloween, buy this album and you won't be disappointed. this album is a very good one, and hansen has the right of even inviting michael kiske to be his vocal pal in ""the land of the free"". i only have one bad think to point out: while the guitar work of every piece is really good and impeccable, i find many solos and riffs a tad boring, since they're too long and repetitive. this was a problem for me to 100% tolerate helloween and iron maiden, and sadly hansen brought the same thing to gr. however, i forgive him for the sake of good music.
some words appart deserve the vocal works of kai hansen, which are particularly brilliant in the remakes of those songs that ralph scheepers sang once. in spite of hansen limitations (compared to scheepers' skills, of course!), hansen's vocals rock! i remember kai hansen in the first helloween ep, and i can see a very positive evolution. now in gr he's really great!
this album can be qualified as a classic of modern times. i give four stars and a half to it. the half i don't give is because of those little defects i just signaled above. this is a carefully crafted production that resumes ten years of gr works. buy it if you like good guitars and good vocals, and simple music that seems to be complex. kai hansen is a genius, and he really deserves respect. kudos for him!","Beautiful box, nice songs, great guitars and good vocals.",990403200,4.0,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1282

highlights:
the majority of the album is really great. sammy's vocal are in top condition, eddie plays like a madman, and the rest of the band delivers. the performances are energetic and full of life, from the opening ""poundcake"" to the closing ""top of the world"". they stake a great stab at the who's classic ""won't get fooled again"", and alex shows his talents on the drums with the nine minute ""pleasure dome/drum solo"". forced to pick a highlight, though i'd go for eddie's 11 minute instrumental ""316"", which also manages to incorporate ""eruption"" at the end.

lowlights:
the reason i don't give this collection five stars is for the performances of the david lee roth songs. sammy actually manages to pull of ""ain't talkin' 'bout love"" and ""jump"" pretty well, but it's ""panama"" that doesn't work. it starts off well enough, but then sammy launches into this whole foul mouthed dialouge about tomorrow and stuff. it's somewhat amusing and a little uplifting, but overall unneccessary. also, i think they leaned a little too heavily on the ""for unlawful carnal knowledge"" tracks. they perform pretty much the whole album. i would've had them do just ""right now"", ""poundcake"", ""316"", ""runaround"" and ""top of the world"" and then do some more stuff ""5150"" and ""ou812"" and maybe some more roth stuff.

overall, this is a great live album. with some changes, it would have been perfect.","Great Collection, But Roth Songs Darg Down The Quality Of This CD",1125878400,4.0,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1286

the instrumentation is very well done with african drums mixed with violin and cello for a mellow string sound. however the trombones are powerful and strategically placed and the timpani adds a sense of the mediterranean.

brendan perry at times sounds brooding, romantic, and passionate like a contemporary lord bryon. his lyrics are usually more easy to understand that lisa  gerrard whose voice is strongest when she evokes the middle eastern traditions.

the comparison to her work in the new pornographers is hard not to make.  i don't think it's entirely fair, but it's also not unwarranted.  case's voice, her open range melodiousness, is unmistakeably beautiful, but in this album, it is also unchallenged.  don't get me wrong, it's a pretty (and, in some cases, haunting) album, but it also plays like something it took no time or energy to record (and no wonder -- it's barely 35 minutes long!).

i think case's sound worked so well with the new pornographers because it was allowed to meld with and mash against the equally stellar work of the rest of her bandmates.  in this album, however, the music behind her vocals is really, really far behind her vocals.  that music is crisply done and polished to a glimmering gloss (which, some might argue, is another fault against the record; a sound like case's really works best without all this lamination), but it also seems afraid to get in the way of case's soaring contralto.

what's good about this collection is also that you get along with the usual pieces that you'd expect to find on any best of baroque compilation such as bach's ""air"" and handel's ""arrival of the queen of sheba"" gems such as my favourite piece here, vivaldi's ""largo"" the melody of which is brilliantly played on classical guitar and is probably one of the most emotionally beautiful pieces of classical music you'll ever hear.

overall, the sound quality is very good too for an undigitally remastered cd and the reason is explained on the back of the cover which says the recordings have been digitally transferred from ""newly remixed original session tapes"" and seeing as how the oldest material here was recorded in 1975 by which time they had quite decent sound recording technology translates into great sound quality overall.

the problem with most ""good"" classical music by the giants such as bernstein and von karajan is that they were recorded decades ago and many times before the 50s on terrible equipment and sometimes worse, in mono! and so you'll have to imagine how good they must have sounded live in the concert hall because they sound horrible on disc.

in many ways this is brilliant.  igor levit is a superb pianist with impeccable technique and a real ability to bring music to life and it is plain that many people have responded with genuine enthusiasm to his playing here.  for my taste, though, it is a little on the over-expressive side at times.  bach shouldn't be just mechanical by any means, but that great pulse which beats throughout his music should be respected, i think, and his magnificent musical architecture allowed to stand without too much being laid over it.  for me, levit rather overdoes the interpretative flourishes and gestures sometimes in a way which detracts from the music rather than adds to it, so i'm hearing rather too much levit and not quite enough bach.

(i have a similar problem with pletnev's playing of scarlatti.  levit's bach seems to me to be another example of a very fine pianist bringing a little too much romantic interpretation into baroque music where it doesn't quite fit.)

at this level of excellence these things are largely a matter of personal taste so don't let me put you off.  many knowledgeable people whose judgement i respect greatly love this, and you may, too.  personally, i'll be sticking to my loved piano recordings by angela hewitt and murray perahia and by trevor pinnock on the harpsichord, and i'll only be giving this a very occasional outing, i suspect.",A little over-interpreted for me,1448496000,6.0,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1320

the band has recognized some of the original recording's shortcomings and have issued remixes and newer versions of some of the songs.  the version i loaded to my computer and burned to cd-r for the road has what i think are the best versions of the songs.

1.  discotheque:  a perfect combination of a rock anthem with electronica beats.  though the version on the cd is very good, the new mix on the best of 1990-2000 is outstanding.  even more ambitious and equally catchy is the 8 minute dance remix which appears on the cd single and relies mostly on an ambient keyboard and house beat.

2.  do you feel loved? - my favorite track on this cd.  the original version is great.  bono sings with a grim desperation and adam clayton provides a great bass line over a larry mullen electronic/rock fused beat.  edge provides his classic riffs with a darker, processed, yet human feel.  the u2 sound blends very naturally in the techno/electronica context on this sound.

3.  mofo - perhaps the most ambitious and successful experiment on this cd.  mofo is truly wild techno rock that few bands have been able to achieve.  the original version is excellent, but the way they performed this one live is outstanding.  if you can find a live version of it, put it on your mix.  the mofo remixes also have some great takes on this song.

4.  if god will send his angels - this track sounds hurried and over-produced.  bono needed to pare down the lyrics, and it sounds like they came up with several different riffs and tones for this song, but did not actually reach agreement on how they wanted the final product to sound.  the underlying song, however, is very good.  it is a moderate to slow ballad that has a country feel despite the electronica keyboard, beats and guitar effects.  i wish they would remake this one.

5.  staring at the sun - the second single from the record.  a very good song which was remixed on the best of 1990-2000.  the best version of this song, however, is the acoustic version they performed live on the pop tour which is on a cd single (`please').  with the electronics stripped away, we hear the great harmonies of bono and edge and the underlying essence of this song.  a great take.

6.  last night on earth - u2 released this as a single and i never understood why.  the writing and hooks are incomplete.  even though it is has the power of u2 rock anthem, this one needed more work.  it is certainly no `hold me, thrill me, kiss me, kill me'.

7.  gone - another real favorite of mine.  the version on the best of 1990-2000 is outstanding and more fully realizes its potential.  there is much more clarity in the guitar playing and in bono's voice.  the subject matter, about a person who has had it easy for so long and doesn't know the meaning or value of anything and finds himself at a critical breaking point, is gripping.  i'd take this song with any great u2 song.

8.  miami - a lot of people hate this track.  i am not a hater, but it did require a lot more work.  a techno track filled with tape loops and guitar samples, but it falls short of some of the tracks on zooropa like `daddy's going to pay for your crashed car' which had more polished writing and song development.

9.  the playboy mansion - the record becomes delightfully unpredictable with this track.  this is a perfect melding of country and electronica, with humorous and insightful lyrics about the playboy mansion as a cultural icon.  johnny cash could've sung this one.  there are plenty of nice hooks and melodies to keep you humming in your car.

10.  if you wear that velvet dress - a haunting, slow, bass driven ballad, with ambient textures and tasteful guitar hooks.  cowboy junkies meet massive attack.  a brilliant achievement.

11.  please - another favorite of mine driven by adam clayton's active bass.  the live version of this track which is available on the `please' cd single is outstanding.  edge is more settled on the guitar parts for this song, and his playing takes this song to another level.

12.  wake up dead man - for anyone who has expressed disgust with those who kill in the name of religion, this song is for you.  the version on the cd is badly overproduced, but the song somehow survives.  i would love to see the band remake this song in an acoustic format.

i just received my ghost on the canvas (limited deluxe edition) in yesterday's mail and have already listened to it 3 times!  i have never written a review before but felt a need to do so now.  i found the music on this album to be very good; glen campbell's voice is as clear and beautiful as always, and the ""guitar picking"" is wonderful.  i was slightly disappointed that the ""limited edition lithograph"" was not signed by glen campbell; i had read that he signed them.

i did however have mixed emotions. first, a little background info.  you see, as a teenager in the late 60's early 70's i had a huge crush on glen campbell.  i bought all of his albums and never missed his goodtime hour tv show.  i always have loved his voice, (and it didn't hurt any that he was so darn cute.)  having said that, there was another reason besides his good looks and beautiful voice that drew me to him.  i saw him as a kind, decent man, and i thought he was a christian.  my first glen campbell concert he ended with the ""lord's prayer.""  at other concerts he sang and played the bagpipes to ""amazing grace.""  articles i read told of his upbringing and christian background.  he also recorded songs such as ""oh happy day,"" and ""i knew jesus, before he was a superstar.""  my hope was to find a man of christian faith like him to marry someday.

i met a wonderful caring christian man, we were married in 1982, and i sort of lost track of glen.  i wasn't hearing his music being played on country radio anymore, and i didn't purchase any further albums.  however, my aunt sent me a magazine article which told of his alcohol and drug abuse.  i was devastated!  when you grow up crushing on a star, you don't stop caring about him as a person.  i later heard that he had come to the lord jesus christ, and of course i was thrilled and very thankful!  i was able to purchase his 3 christian music cds.  his beautiful recording of ""jesus and me"" brought tears to my eyes.

now, back to ghost on the canvas.  my concern is that the words are somewhat ambiguous,and there is not the clear witness for jesus that was present on his christian cds.  since it is supposed to be the story of glen campbell's life and his farewell album, i was hoping for a last powerful witness for jesus.  his letter to his fans makes no mention of the lord, and his ""thank-yous"" don't include god either.  a couple of the songs mention heaven and/or allude to it by calling it ""a better place.""  but there is no gospel there.  no mention of the sacrifice jesus made for all of us by dying on the cross and taking our sins away, and the salvation that is ours if we believe in him.

i was naturally very sorry to hear of glen's alzheimer's disease, and i was touched by the tribute given him at last year's cma's.  i wish he was coming to denver (or anywhere in co) on his farewell tour, but it doesn't look like i'll ever see him perform live again.  i pray that jesus will be with glen and his family and that he will spare them much suffering.  but mostly my prayer is that glen campbell and his family, and all of you reading this, do accept jesus' sacrifice for all our sins.  then we will rejoice together in heaven one day.",Great - But Missing One Thing,1325980800,2.0,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1349

i played burn my eyes over and over during the remainder of my stay in kenya and never ceased to be amazed by the originality of the album.  few bands have been this competent playing at such a wide variety of tempos, sometimes within a single song - just check out ""nation on fire"" or ""none but my own"" if you don't believe me.  burn my eyes might just be the greatest thrash metal debut of all-time, an astonishing possibility considering it came out in 1994, several years after the golden era of thrash came to an end.  sadly, burn my eyes also puts machine head's future releases to shame.  you have no idea my disappointment when i procured a tape of their follow-up, the more things change, and found it to be good but uninspired in comparison.  and don't even get me started on the burning red - a cover of the police classic ""message in a bottle""?  enough said.

i've got burn my eyes on here in pittsburgh right now and it's taking me back to kenya, just like i knew it would.  so much rage, so much beauty.  wow, what an essential album for any self-respecting metalhead.  can you believe there were american metal bands this good as recently as the mid-1990s?  brings a tear to your eye, doesn't it?",The Greatest Thrash Metal Debut Ever?,1035417600,,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1360

among the numbers not heard in the televised documentary are brian's demos of ""heroes and villians"" and 'breakaway"", an early take of ""do it again"", concert rehearsal versions of ""good vibrations and ""god only knows"" ( both complete with exquisite lead vocals by carl wilson ) and astonishing live performances of ""wonderful"" ( performed in medley form along with ""don't worry bill"" ), ""heroes and villians"", ""long promised road""  (again featuring a lovely carl vocal ) and a blah medley of ""surfin' safari"", ""fun fun fun"", ""shut down"", ""little deuce coupe"" and ""surfin' usa"".

this collection also allowed me to be acquainted with an oboist previously not known to me, celia nicklin.  she performs vaughan williams concerto for oboe and strings, ably backed by academy of st. martin in the fields with sir neville.  this pastoral work is dreamy and flowing, and nicklin's playing enhances this with clarity and clear tonal sound.

the gepr reviews tend to describe after crying as  similar to king crimson circa islands. this is superficially true in that  the instrumentation is similar, and compositionally they're in the same  ballpark as well, but after crying definitely have a spirit and feel all  their own. for one thing, fripp's monster guitar sound is totally absent  from after crying's sound; i can also say they're nowhere near as  arty-farty as islands was often guilty of.
the lyrics are all in  hungarian, which is sort of a shame because i have the distinct feeling  that knowing the words would greatly enhance one's enjoyment of this disc,  as the previous reviewer mentioned. the singer sort of brings to mind greg  lake's vocals during the quieter moments of king crimson's *in the wake of  poseidon*. there are two very long pieces (22 and 11 minutes) and three  shorter pieces (all under 3-1/2 minutes). musically, there's a big chamber  music influence at work here, with mournful, minor-keyed viola/violins the  most prominent instrument, often backed with atmospheric string synths.  more rock-oriented is the title track (the 11-minute piece), which features  drums and some great david cross-like violin, and somewhat recalls  *sailor's tale* from islands for the first half, though not as frenetic.  the second part of this piece is much quieter, more contemplative, and very  sad-sounding. great stuff!

this is a bootleg version of a show that's freely available from the little feat archive, & though it's slightly edited, ( no-in-between song chit-chat etc etc ), there's no noticeable improvement in sound quality to my ears, as this was originally a free-to-air radio broadcast. it should be remembered that the feat receive no royalties here either...

so what do you get for your money ?

it comes very well packaged, & has some reasonably accurate liner-notes that offer some historical significance for the times. in years to come, its uniqueness may make this disc become possibly sought after.

the songs themselves are well played ( as always ), & it's a worthy addition to any little feat fans collection. sonically speaking, it's no waiting for columbus, but it's not bad at all for the times & situation either. definitely much better value for your money awaits with the purchase of ""live in holland"" that comes with a dvd movie of the bands gig in holland for similar dollars paid !

sometimes wearing a mask allows us the freedom to show a side of ourselves that we might otherwise be afraid to reveal.  here, e has assumed a persona of sorts, which differs from anything his audience has seen to date.  he's a lusty, swaggering wolfman, carrying a cane and prowling the night.  this assumed role seems to allow him to project a confidence unheard in much of his material, displayed most clearly on the opening track ""prizefighter"" and the single ""fresh blood.""  but what makes this album most compelling is when e drops the guise and reveals his true insecurities, as on ""the look you give that guy.""  that dichotomy makes this wolfman seem all the more human, for beneath the fuzz and fangs still lies a fundamentally reflective and at times insecure person.

the conceptual aspect of this disc is fun and meaningful, but never threatens to overwhelm the content.  song-for-song, this is one of e's best collections.  almost every one of these tracks could stand on its own as a single.  the stripped-down sound that e has featured on some of his rawer albums (souljacker, for example) is in full effect and really works in e's favor.  overall the man sounds energized, mature and confident, always with something interesting and often poignant to say.

e remains the consummate cult artist, and in many ways it's not surprising.  his unflinching portraits of insecurity and emotion take some getting used to, especially in the current musical climate.  each project he records is something unique and interesting.  this is one of his best to date.",Behind the wolf,1243987200,28.0,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1397

gergiev gives a characteristically weighty interpretation of all this music. this suits the music well. in the pictures for instance, many of the images are inherently dark in mood such as in the gnomus, samuel goldenberg and schmuyle, catacombes and cum mortuis. others are potentially weighty in construction such as bydlo and il vecchio castello. in general therefore, this comes over as a fairly sombre view of this piece rather than the more obviously virtuosic but emptier type of interpretation.

the night on the bare mountain is given a more driven performance yet still with a dark or even threatening side to it. this is harder to achieve in rimsky korsakov's version as here compared to the much rougher original orchestration by the composer. the prelude to khovanshchina is also richly sombre in mood, although by no means as sumptuous and larger than life as in stokowski's famous account. the gopak makes an enjoyable encore.

there are many fine performances of the pictures including historically significant ones by reiner and szell for instance. there is also the famous karajan version to consider. all of those are well recorded for their respective vintages.

anyways, ""cowboys from hell"" is pantera's first major label album (and their fifth full length release overall), and it is without question one of the all time greatest and most influential albums in all of metal music. with this album, the texas based foursome would enter 1990 going through a complete total transformation by evolving from their glam/hair metal past for a much more heavier thrash/groove metal sound with even some power metal influences thrown in as well. from beginning to end, ""cowboys from hell"" is an absolute classic masterpiece of pure full-on, blistering, neck-breaking and headbanging heavy metal to the max, and no doubt, it also put pantera right on the map as one of metal's greatest and most influential bands ever. it is just absolutely amazing. every song on this album is definitely essential listening and has that classic pantera sound yet still maintaining some touches of their 80's sound. everything about cfh is just absolutely amazing from guitarist dimebag darrell's iconic riffs and solos, to vinnie paul and rex brown's dynamic and powerful rhythm section, and to vocalist philip anselmo's unbelievably mind-blowing vocal dynamics. the production which was handled by none other than terry date (who would also produce 1992's ""vulgar display of power"", 1994's ""far beyond driven"" and 1996's ""the great southern trendkill"") is just absolutely top-notch with everything being balanced and you can totally hear everything on here. now first off, let's talk about phil's vocals which are just absolutely mind-blowing, dynamic and well varied throughout this album ranging from everything from harsh, gruff and aggressive growls, yells, shouts and screams, to awesome soulful, melodic singing, to even some amazing high-pitched, falsetto-like wails that are almost reminiscent that of rob halford as evident on songs such as ""shattered"", ""heresy"", ""psycho holiday"", ""clash with reality"" and ""medicine man"". dimebag darrell (whom was credited as diamond darrell on here) meanwhile is whom i easily consider to be the greatest guitarist in all of heavy music in my opinion. the guy's unbelievable skills and talent here on cfh is put on full display as he shreds and blazes his way throughout these twelve songs with his iconic heavy-duty riffs and incredibly mind-blowing solos like nobody else's business. no question, this guy was a true metal legend and a down-to-earth human being as well. elsewhere, you've got both vinnie paul and rex both rounding off this impressive cast of characters with their incredibly impressive and blistering rhythm section as vinnie drives and powers his way throughout with his awesome thundering, hard-pounding drumming and rex keeps in perfect pace with dime's guitar with his strong, solid and hearable bass lines as well.

kicking off this masterpiece of an album of course is the classic anthemic title track, ""cowboys from hell"", and boy oh boy, what an amazing opening track this really is. i love how it starts off with a really weird yet cool guitar intro which is soon followed by a more harder and heavier set of pounding, rapid-fast, cascading and energetic riffing backed up by strong, hard-pounding, mosh-worthy drums and catchy, infectious grooves throughout. phil's vocals in this song are aggressive and awesome as well, plus it is also highlighted by a memorable shout-a-long chorus and an amazingly killer, winding and shredding guitar solo from dime to boot. this is definitely one of my favorite songs on the album, and i'm just only getting started here. the second track, ""primal concrete sledge"" is a short yet very aggressive drum-based number that is anchored by a seriously fast and unstoppable barrage of insane double bass drumming by vinnie paul throughout, plus it also features some fast, growling and mad-buzzing riffage and fast and aggressive vocals from anselmo to boot as well, plus the chorus is also worth mentioning too. next up, we have track three, ""psycho holiday"" which is another one of my favorites here that is highlighted by a slew of amazingly catchy and heavy, fast chugging, speaker-blaring riffage throughout and also contains a nice and catchy groove to it. the drumming here in this song is also hard-pounding and consistent, plus there's yet another incredibly wicked, wailing and winding dime solo mid-way through, and phil's vocals are also pure gold especially during the chorus when he wails ""i'm on a psycho holiday""! i love it. the album's next track, ""heresy"" is a more thrashier track that starts with some cool guitar harmonics before shape-shifting into pure thrashing territory as it boasts blisteringly fast charging, crunching riffage, shredding bass lines, along with fast and aggressive drumming that really adds to the song. the chorus in this song is also pure bliss especially when phil shrieks ""heresyyyy""!"" another another awesome dimbag solo, the song gets very interesting at 3:30 with some killer heavy riffing and double bass drumming that will get you headbanging like nuts, it's just so good. this song here is just heavy as all hell, i love it. definitely another favorite.

moving forward, we have the amazingly powerful 7 minute power ballad, ""cemetery gates"" which is so emotionally driven yet it maintains it's heaviness in it's own right. this song is without question one of pantera's best songs ever as well as one of my all time favorites too. words just cannot even begin to describe how much i love it. ""cemetery gates"" begins with a beautifully dreary and melodic acoustic opening which also features some nice soulful clean vocals from phil before thrusting into a powerfully heavy and catchy metal song filled with excellent riffs and awesome drumming all leads by phil's amazing vocals. the song also features awesome pre-choruses which lead into one of the greatest choruses in any pantera song, and there's also yet another incredible solo by dime (and one of his best solos btw) near the five minute mark as well, plus i also love where phil wails ""gaaaates""! right near the end of song which just urges you to sing along everytime you hear him sing that. amazing, amazing song. next, we have ""domination"" which is in my opinion the best song on the album, and it's also my all time favorite pantera song as well. this song is an explosive monster of a thrasher that just beats and pummels your brains in with it's aggressive and relentless assault of fast chugging and bludgeoningly heavy riffs, heavy pounding drumming (with some great double bass kicking included) and excellent vocal deliveries from phil especially during the verses. however the two main highlights of this monster of a song here would first have to be dimebag's incredibly awesome solo which erupts at the 3:18 mark and ending at 3:51 when then sets the stage for what is in my opinion the best breakdown that i've heard in any metal song which includes some monstrous pounding power chords along with another sick and shredding dime solo that is just guaranteed to send shivers down your spine. all in all, ""domination"" is just an absolute monster. believe me, this songs is just as metal as metal can truly get. i love it.

track seven, ""shattered"" is another excellent thrash/speed metal number that is a real treat for any fan of thrash and speed as it is anchored by blisteringly fast, complex riffing, fast thumping and pounding double bass drumming, plus another sick, winding and deliciously ear-shredding dimebag solo is also featured here, however it is phil's vocals in this song that are the real highlight for me. his singing is just absolutely godly here as he hits his high notes with absolute perfection and authority throughout especially during the verses, and not to mention the chorus is just pure awesomeness. another monster of a song here. next up, we have track eight, ""clash with reality"" which is an awesomely heavy, groove-based thrash beastie that is just chock full of incredibly heavy, aggressive, chugging, heart-racing and bone-crunching riffage, heavy, deft, thumping and pounding drum beats, as well as more of phil's amazingly soaring high-pitched wails and aggressive screams to boot. the song is also highlighted by another superb and memorable chorus, and there's also a killer breakdown of great pummeling riffs near the 3 minute mark which leads into another insanely awesome solo by dime at 3:37, and the song also tends to speed up with some faster guitars and drums right near the end of the song after a final reprise of the chorus as well. track nine, ""medicine man"" meanwhile is a very swinging, catchy and groovy number that features some very cool bass work from rex brown, along with a very catchy groove and great catchy riff and drum work from dime and vinnie respectively, and also features some low, deep singing from phil yet he manages to break in his soaring falsettos off and on, as well as an awesome heavy chorus, plus another awesome dime solo to top it off.

moving on, the tenth track, ""message in blood"" is another one of my favorites here that is highlighted by yet more of dime's incredibly heavy-duty, grinding, and churning riffs, plus another phenomenally wailing, winding and screaming solo is also featured (and another one of dime's best i might add) along with some great contrasting calm and loud sections, and the chorus in this song is also just fantastic as well, and it's another one of my favorite choruses on this album. next up, we have ""the sleep"" which is also another huge highlight on here that features an eerie acoustic guitar opening before ultimately transforming into a crushingly epic metal tour de force with amazingly heavy, crunching and grinding riffage and awesome deep, melodic sung vocals and great dark lyrics, and the song is also topped off with yet another one of dimebag's absolute best guitar solos and a very impressive and memorable chorus to go along with it. the guitar solo in this song is just simply jaw-dropping from start to finish, i just love it. such an amazing song. the album then finally closes up shop with the blistering and energetic closing thrasher ""the art of shredding"" which starts off with some great mid-paced drumming along with some brilliant heart-pumping bass work and then we have a very catchy and crunchy, throat-grabbing riff that comes into play and then moments later, the song then morphs into a catchy, hard stomper of a thrash tune that boasts lightning fast, chuggy, bone-crunching riffage, heavy stomping, fist-pumping double bass thuds, flowing bass lines all topped off by phil's awesome as always vocal deliveries. the song is also highlighted by another awesome chorus, as well as a cool frenzied guitar and drum section at the 2:23 mark, and of course another amazing solo by dimebag before the final reprise of the chorus which eventually concludes the song and the album itself.

all in all, ""cowboys from hell"" is an absolute true metal masterpiece, and it honestly makes absolutely no sense at all for you to consider yourself a true metalhead and not own this classic album in your collection. this album here has got everything that you could think of from heaviness, to groove, melody, aggression and of course power, and not to also mention that cfh would also be the beginning of a series of amazingly awesome albums from these headbanging texans throughout the 90's, but this album here however still remains my all time favorite pantera album to this very day forward. anyways i strongly encourage any metalhead of any age who does note own this monster of an album to buy it now without any further delay. definitely worth the hard earned money for sure...just buy the album already!!!

also, may the spirit and legacy of ""dimebag"" darrell lance abbott (august 20, 1966 - december 8, 2004) live forever and be honored by the metal community's eternal spirit. not only was he an amazing musician, but he was also a genuine and down-to-earth human being overall. keep on rocking for all eternity dimebag!!! we all love you and we will never forget you!!! \m/ \m/

""odessey  and oracle"" reflects this awe in that you hear influences of different  artists. for instance, one could hear a bit of the beatles (especially  since the album was recorded directly after ""sgt pepper's lonely  hearts club band"")in 'care of cell 44' and 'a rose for emily', a bit  of procol harum in 'beechwood park', and a little bit of the doors in 'time  of the season'. that said, never does the zombies' own identity get lost in  being copycats. the songs all retain those ethereal and otherworldly  qualities that make the zombies' trademark sound. it was a new and improved  zombies.  and yet, ""odessey and oracle"" was recorded under what  many would consider dire circumstances. their contract with decca expired,  they signed up with cbs on a trial basis, cbs allowed only enough money to  mix the album in mono (the stereo mix came out of rod's and chris' royalty  money)and colin, hugh and paul were running out of money. being one of the  first non-emi artists to record at the famed abbey road studios, the  zombies had to record around everybody else's schedule and had to high tail  it out of the studio when an emi artist was ready to record (in fact, it is  rumoured that workers made off with a piano in the midst of the zombies  laying down a vocal track!) plus, at a time of psychedelic extravagance,  the zombies had access to a limited array of instruments (no sitars, tablas  or 41 piece orchestras here folks). lesser artists would have either fallen  flat on their faces or given up.  i think that these circumstances and  limitations actually benefited the music. the limited studio time forced  them to make quick but intelligent decisions about songwriting and  arrangements (their greatest strengths). the zombies had to write their  songs, learn them quickly, and decide on an arrangement before going into  the studio. also, the revolving use of piano, organ, harpsichord, harmonium  and mellotron (and their various combinations) actually helped to create  aural continuity (as opposed to conceptual continuity in ""sgt  pepper"") throughout the album. in that respect,""odessey""  does compare to the beach boys' ""pet sounds"" album.  the  highlights of ""odessey and oracle"" are the shimmering 'beechwood  park', the gorgeously melancholic 'a rose for emily', the psychedelic 'hung  up on a dream', the choir like sounds of 'changes' and the spooky anti-war  ballad 'butcher's tale (western front 1914)."" i'm sure many will find  their own favourites here.  ""odessey and oracle"" is like a  tribute album to the sounds of 1967 and is enjoyable listening. the zombies  grabbed on to these sounds and vibes and recorded this wonderful echo of  the psychedelic era. and now, with big beat providing us with both mono  (which has never been available here in the states) and stereo mixes of  this album, we get a whole new perspective on this fabulous echo.",Took a Long Time To Come,969321600,43.0,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1406

it all begins with an eerie and sparse intro. which literally explodes into one of the heaviest tracks opeth has ever put on wax: the moor.  this opening opus is a perfect taste for what is to come, and at this time in opeth's career, ushered in a new level of vocal and songwriting proficiency.  when this song finally hits the verse section at the 3:30 mark, all hell breaks loose as mikael unleashes the beast that has now become one of, if not the best death metal vocals in the business.  as the song violently twists and turns through pulverizing riffs, drum blasts, and solos, opeth integrates their trademark acoustic sections with a grace not present before, or replicated since.

in giving this album the edge over blackwater park, i think this very element, the seemingly impossible symbiosis of the distorted and clean sections, is indicative of what makes this the crowning achievement in opeth's career thus far: the songwriting.

instead of simply attaching clean and distorted passages together, opeth splices them.  the effect is often a haunting soundscape which can can unfold into more intensely quiet acoustic movements, or continue to emphasize the endlessly sustained distorted gutair melodies.

matching the polarized quality of the instrumentation is a stunning juxtaposition of clean and death vocals.  the clean vocals on ""the moor"", ""godhead's lament"", and ""face of melinda"" are exquisite, and provide a perfect complement to the menacing growl so unmatched in contemporary metal.  unlike all other opeth albums, still life also finds the vocal arrangements at their most natural.  at times, it seems that opeth songs make the vocal transitions out of habit/expectation.  like the integrated acoustic/heavy passages though, every vocal change on this album is methodically and effectively placed.  on this masterpiece, the vocals match the mood, and not necessarily the intensity of the musical backdrop.

the result of this assiduous songwriting is a perfect collection of vivid tapestries, all telling their own stories, which, as stories mimic life, do not just lean on one emotion, but follow a progression of cause and effect.  each dark composition weaves together the mutually dependent feelings of melancholy, rage, despondency, isolation, betrayal, and regret.  and while anyone who knows my opinion of opeth knows that its ability to create palpable emotion is, in my opinion, what truly sets it apart from other metal bands, no other opeth release can match the pathos of still life.

with still life, opeth secured the place as my favorite band.  a band of epic, progressive, and crushing proportions, opeth exploited its assets to the absolute fullest on this release.  any fan of true metal, even those who do not tolerate death metal vocals, must hear this album.  to hear still life is to witness the unavoidable change and progression of life.  as should be the task of us all, opeth has taken the accumulation of the greatness of the past to create an indelible and unparalleled mark upon the world which reflects a respect for the past, and the added ingredient of its own originality.  not only is still life opeth's finest, but it's one of this music fan's top five albums of all time.",Opeth's Finest,1131580800,11.0,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1413

 the first time i heard this album, in 1985, it knocked me flat. it changed not only what i listened to, but the way i listened to music. it turned me on to jazz, and taught me to actually sit down and listen......well...you had to as there was so much to listen to!
 the album features jazz regulars like harvey mason,  members of the miles davis quartet,weather report, as well the santana band, and, as one would expect, the musicianship is top notch. the music itself is a heady brew/ fusion of high octane arvant-guarde free-form electric jazz  and  meditative spiritualist soundscapes.
  other reviewers say the results are a bit mixed and spotty, and yes perhaps there is one or two(or three) tracks that are not quite there, but nonetheless, i think the outcome is highly satisfying.
 my favourites:
 swapan tari is one track all santana fans ahould hear, with  blistering, frantic ""free for all"" guitar and saxophone(rusell tubbs)  solos. its  mad but brilliant.
  love theme from spartacus is absolutely beautiful, starting off with a most quiet, gentle guitar intro along with herbie hancock. the inro slowly escalates into a most exotic, ethereal saxophone solo(wayn shorter) that almost leaves one in tears of ecstasy, followed  by a very minimalist but sensous guitar.
 jharna khala is a real kick in the pants abstract roller-coaster tune with sax(russell tubbs) and keyboard(hancock)  topped off by a guitar finish.
 but probably the best of all is shere khan the tiger. turn the lights out low, grab your favourite wine, and prepare to be transported someplace else. the musicianship on this one is stratospheric, and the tune surreal and  meditative. the song features the most dreamlike, zen like leadout with a  most graceful interchange of guitar (santana), keyboards(herbie hancock), acoustic bass (ron carter), drums (harvey mason), and  saxophone(wayne shorter)you will probably ever hear.
 as for santana himself, be prepared for some real playing. his guitar playing is an absolute treat, with  such a huge range of sensitivities, from slow, elegant, gentle, and minimalist, to fast and furious, and notes a plenty. he has, in my oppinion a very unique blend, with a rock sound , but with a jazz approach.
 as one reviewer has said , yes, the tunes are a nod to sri chimmoy, and are very mantra like with exotic titles.
 i highly recommend this album, and if you are: a) a guitarist b) a santana fan, or c) jazz fan, one cannot and should not walk past this album.
 be inspired,  go change your life, go and buy this album.

kiss me, kiss me, kiss me is so fun to explore and really highlights the cure's eclecticism and wide range of talents. there are so many standout songs for me, but my favorite would have to be ""like cockatoos"" with a tricky, spiraling and masterful vocal from smith and the bizarre sound of psychedelic birds in flight.
also, if pressed, i would have taken off ""shiver and shake"" which is energetic, frazzled, nasty and angry but a bit of a throwaway while ""hey you!!!,"" also a bit of a tossed-off tune, finds the cure in full party mode which is a key aspect of this album. (""hey you!!!"" was removed so this double album could fit on one disc.)
note: as brilliant as the cure is, the biggest complaint i hear about them from my non-fan friends is smith's vocals which are admittedly rather thin and crackly. however, if you can get past that, he is a very emotive vocalist and an excellent vocal stylist who can truly do some amazing things with his pipes. i really love his voice, faults and all!",A Blast!!!,1078790400,2.0,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1421

another thing that helps to truly enjoy this set is to have experienced this era of music or at least to know what a horrible state popular music was in the mid 80's before nirvana, and in the mid 90's, just after nirvana. nirvana was not promoted to death when nevermind came out in order to make it big the way springsteen was in 1975 with born to run, another album on the fringe and outside the mainstream for it's time (i'm a huge boss fan by the way). btr was marketed like crazy. in 1991, when rock was much more corporate than in 1975, nirvana's nevermind was one of a handful of albums ever that made an it big immediately without a huge marketing effort. all of a sudden the album and band were everywhere. they broke down the door for pearl jam, soundgarden, and all the other bands that had been waiting in the wings.

those who rip nirvana as ""rehash of the pixies"" or a pearl jam ripoff don't know the nirvana story and must have missed out on everything before, during and after nirvana. although, i loved the pixes and respected pearl jam back then, it was pearl jam and a slew of other bands that 'capitalized' on nirvana breaking down the corporate rock door. although pearl jam rocked, their songs are far too pretentious. cobain was 100% authentic, original. nirvana was just the opposite of pearl jam in many ways. outside of neil young, bob dylan, john lennon, and a few others no one in rock comes close to being a real artist like cobain. a deeper insight into this is what makes this box set worth every penny.

i know this review doesn't give you much insight into the box set. you can find other reviewers providing details on each cd and the dvd. but i must respond to the ridiculous reviews some of the non-nirvana fans are posting here.

personally, i think that this is van's best, most well-rounded album since too long in exile. it has all the joyful bounce of street choir and moondance as well as a taste of his introspective mid-period moods.
my favorites are talk is cheap, choppin' wood (ok, the background vocals are obnoxious but its still a great song), the maligned all work and no play (its those background vocals again), the soulful whatever happened to pj proby, only a dream, and evening shadows.
that last merits special mention. originally written as an instrumental by 50s soft-jazz pioneer acker bilk, van adds lyrics to evening shadows which really fit the music then brings bilk aboard to do a clarinet solo on his own music brought to life! tremendous!
about the only song i don't care for is van's rendition of georgia on my mind, but then that song has never been a favorite anyhow.
i'm with the reviewer who said he did not care if van broke no new ground. he has given the world forty years of wonderful music and its hard to see what new ground he could possibly break. i highly recommend down the road to one and all.",All the Joy and Beauty of Days Gone By,1034640000,30.0,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1451

most recordings made in vienna's shoe-box shaped musikverein, have come from live sources. this must be a studio recording. this is the first recording of a major work played by the vpo that can begin to approach the sonic results that they regularly used to get, ""back in the day"", at the old sofiensaal (eventually burnt down). sonically speaking, this is far better than what you hear on either the kaplan or boulez mahler ""resurrection"" recordings, for example. point is, the sound is excellent.

here's another ""vienna factor"": the 10th - especially in the cooke edition - has always sounded a bit too thin, or too ""nude"" in the bass. the musikverein, on the other hand, has always been generous to the lower end of the audio spectrum, and the viennese double basses and celli are among the best anywhere. as a result, and as mentioned previously, the vienna phil. make the cooke version (goldschmidt, really) sound more filled out; more natural; more complete.

all this said, there are performances i like better for tempo relationships. the two outer movements aren't nearly so slack sounding on the recent noseda/bbc phil. m10 (chandos), while their ""purgatorio"" (middle movement) doesn't sound quite so rushed either. still, the viennese strings can sustain excess slack in the outer movements better than most. personally, i prefer that the first movement go much quicker when doing the entire 10th (as opposed to playing the adagio by itself). harding stretches the first movement well beyond 25 minutes, while ormandy is 15 seconds shy of 22 minutes. but it's hard to argue with the results the vienna strings get in the last movement, even if i prefer a less gossamer approach to mahler's final reach back towards young, idealistic love (let's call it a ""reach"", and not just a glance).

kudos on three other important points as well:

first, like rattle, harding links the last movements with just a single drum stroke, not two.

second, also like rattle, harding takes everything from the second scherzo's (4th movement) final expressionistic outburst, to the beginning of the fifth movement, quite slowly. this lends a very shostakovich like atmosphere to the final two minutes of the fourth movement.

third, and not least, harding doesn't blow you out of the room with his solo bass drum shots; the ""muted"" drum sensibly played on a bass drum (pleeeeaze, no more tenor drums, tom-toms, bongos, etc.). combined with an excellent solo tuba, as well as sound quality that can pick up all the soft tam-tam strokes, you'd be very hard pressed to find a more effective or atmospheric sounding start to the finale. that alone counts for plenty.","not my very favorite, but still very, very good",1226620800,,,,CDs,a1454

it wasn't until years later that i found out how many of the great songwriters and bands of the last decade name the pixies as one of their prime influences and inspirations. there's so much stuff mixed and twisted around in here (punk, rock, country, surf, metal, electronic, pop) that, hearing it described, it's hard to not imagine it as an aural train wreck. somehow they not only make it work, but this music is simply timeless and it's totally dissolved in my blood now. it's amazing to me that to this day, most people have never even heard of the pixies, never mind like them.
you would be doing yourself a great disservice by not at least trying this album (which, along with ""bossanova"" is what i would recommend). first find out if a friend happens to have it, or download some of the songs (""wave of mutilation"", ""monkey gone to heaven"", ""no. 13 baby""), because as i said it's very difficult to like right away. keep these songs around a while and listen to them a few times while you clip your toenails. it's not for everyone. if you're a big britney spears or celine dion or even rolling stones fan, then beware. there might be some vomiting and there's even an outside chance your head might just explode on the spot.
anyway the point is to get past the weirdness of it and appreciate its utter originality. i've never heard anyone accuse the pixies of copying or imitating or ripping anyone else off, which is something you could say about very few bands of any kind. they play chords you've never heard before and that probably don't appear in any chord book at your local music school. sounds out of tune? yep...intentionally. time signatures change up all over the place, but yet it works. the vocals go from screamingly raw to haunting to playful. black francis truly has one of the most unique voices you will ever hear.

""i belong to you"" was a substantial hit in this vein, but i preferred their more uptemp hits. still, they deserve their rightful place as one of the great girl groups of their era. this compilation is fine, (the female version of barry's bedroom soul, in a way), but there was something fresh and radical about ""under the influence"" when it came out; there was a time when it seemed like everyone i met had a copy and was playin' it. i still play me some love unlimited from time to time, and their best cuts still sound fabulous; these ladies really had it goin' on for awhile.","I Remember Being ""Under the Influence of Love"" Unlimited!",1383609600,,,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},CDs,a1477

'foolish games', 'who will save your soul' and 'you were  meant for me' are excellent songs in their own right, but to think those  are the only songs that could possibly be good on this cd is the  understatement of the century.
being a songwriter and guitarist myself i  can appreciate the simple complexity of this disc.  songs like 'pieces of  you', which is about how people put down other people possibly because they  see a little of themselves in those they don't like, flows like rain on a  roof top.  'little sister' and 'daddy' pull you into her little canvas and  you suddenly become the centerpiece of her art.  she pulls you into these  songs to the point you seem to know the people she is talking about in  them.  'angel standing by' and 'painter' are masterpieces in my mind.  the  way her voice flows over the melodies can put you in a trance and the music  feeds your soul with it's passion and honesty.

some people might prefer it's alive over this one, since it contains all the early stuff and all the songs sound similar to the originals. however, this album is much louder and faster, and contains newer songs as well as the classics, all performed at unremittingly breakneck tempos.
the only unfortunate thing about this album is that joey went back into the studio and re-recorded vocals for a lot of this album (you can tell where this has happened most of the time, in the places where is voice is smoother than in the rest of the album). this does, however, make the album a bit better musically.

a possibly good product although each packet is much larger in size to other non sugar sweeteners.  (think a sugar packet stuffed to the max.)  stevia is a natural leaf product that sweetens that many countries have used for decades safely.  so why did coke and cargill block stevia from use in the us, through congress, for over 20 years until they could figure out to use it to make money for coke and cargill?  after all, they did know that stevia was a natural sweetener used around the world before getting their paid henchmen (congress and the fda) to stop the sale of stevia until they could figure how to make bucks off of it.  (how they could stop people using a natural product until they could refine and make tons of money off of it is beyond me as japan was using it for decades safely.)  i assume a lot of congressmen and folks in other government departments got some good money from these companies for 2 decades. cargill refuses to disclose what the manufacture process is and what extra ingredients are in it that make the packet so large and what extra binders and additives are in it besides the chemically treated stevia, which was naturally green, to turn into a white powder.  what chemicals did they use to bleach it from green to white and what else have they added to it?  i don't know what's in this and neither do a lot of folks but if you want to try truvia this is a very fair deal.  they claim it to be sweeter than splenda but it does not seem sweeter to me.

i can't guarantee or speak about long term safety because this hasn't been out long enough but i find that it takes more packets of truvia to sweeten (actually lessen the bitterness of) my coffee than splenda does. this just seems (to me) to cut the bitterness rather than add a sweet taste and to be honest i do add splenda to sweeten it more, which kind of defeats the purpose of, what now is, this exercise in futility.  when you see the packet you'll understand what i mean about the size especially when  you tear it open.  possibly a better alternative to splenda or at least seemingly slightly more natural than chlorinated sugar (splenda).

you would probably be better off just buying pure stevia.  i also see some companies offering stevia/sugar mix packets.",Is Truvia safe to use?  We'll see.  Why won't Cargill say whats in it? They also lost the right to call it natural.,1361145600,3.0,,,grocery,a1501

if you have an issue with this drink, expect not to get a response from the company.

what a waste of money. $3 a bottle is insane and i fell for it.

update:
yes, they were refrigerated in the grocery.
i spoke with a rep from the company.

she said the bottles were probably unfrigeraterated or above 50 degrees for too long, causing the beverage to have this reaction (almost like carbonization).

but amazon ran out of the stuff i use, my monthly shipment didn't arrive, and there was no word from amazon as to when they'd have it in stock again. i got desperate and went to the local supermarket. they had a variety of so-called stevia products, but i recognized the first ingredient in each one as something i can't have, like maltodextrin. the first ingredient in truvia is erythritol, and i didn't know what that was. so i decided to give it a try.

huge mistake.

the first thing i noticed was that you need a large quantity of this stuff to make something taste even remotely sweet. the next thing i noticed was that it gives me the runs--big time. this might not be true for most people, but if you suffer from stomach candida, you're probably going to experience the same thing.

so i looked up erythritol on wikipedia, and this is what i found out. it's a sugar alcohol, and it occurs naturally in some fermented (as in spoiled) fruits and foods. at the industrial level, it's produced by fermenting glucose (as in sugar) with yeast. in other words, if you have a stomach candida problem, you might as well be sweetening your food with a laxative.

so i've ordered a different kind of stevia extract--real stevia and only real stevia--and i'll have to make do with no sweetener at all until it arrives. do not order truvia if you're not supposed to have yeast or anything fermented. just don't.",Don't buy if you have problems digesting yeast or alcohol!,1352592000,16.0,,,grocery,a1614

wow! just like they used to bake in the olden days!!... with palm, canola, and coconut oils...

palm oil and canola (more properly known as rapeseed) oil aren't fit for human consumption (a very short wikipedia search will reveal why.) if anna had known about rapeseed oil at all, it would have been as fuel and lubrication and she never would have considered cooking with it. and how a swede would have gotten ahold of (expensive, imported) palm and coconut oils in 1929, and why she would ever have considered using them instead of butter to bake with, is beyond me.

overall, this coffee can best be described as mild. given that it is priced slightly above eight o'clock, the price leader (and value leader in my opinion), and does not match the taste and smell, i would recommend that you look either above or below this price point.",This is supposed to be good coffee?,1372809600,,,,grocery,a1706

i don't know if jpf  genuinely can't offer its products for less -- given its challenging but laudable goal of using only organic foods and spices -- but at the msrp of $7.00 for literally a handful of chips/strips, it's impossible to justify ordering or eating these at all regularly.  (for an idea of what you can expect from a bag, see the attached pic of seasoned zucchini strips for a ""pretty typical"" pic of jpf product bag contents.)  with no discount even offered on the company's own site for bulk purchases (i.e., it's $7/bag whether you're buying 1 or 12), it's impossible to justify ordering or eating these at all regularly.

i find this disappointing, because like most people, i could really benefit from having more healthy, viable alternatives to all the junk snacks out there.  the jpf line could have been a serious contender for me.  the chips/strips are crispy and flavorful, and even though, for example, i hate zucchini as a rule, i could easily see myself reaching for a bag of these strips twice a day ...  just not at this price.

amazon, thank you for making it possible to try products that aren't readily available in my local stores.  jpf, i really hope you can figure out some way to manufacture your products that neither undercuts your mission nor downgrades the quality of your product ... but that allows you either to lower your price per bag or at least double (and maybe even triple!) what you're offering inside each one.  if not, i suspect that over time, you will mostly find yourselves selling to people who try your products once or twice, but never convert into long-term repeat customers because of the price barrier.  but good luck!","Much too much for much too little.

my family is me (the mom - 32), my husband (31), my oldest son (11), my daughter (7), and my toddler son (1.5). guess who liked and who did not.....

my toddler was the only one who would take more than one bite. :/ we had the apple cinnamon and it was not the pastry dough that we disliked as a whole but the filling. for me, it was too sour.

to be fair, we never had a chance to toast them, and that might make all the difference in the world, i'm not sure. my oldest has severe allergies so we are used to trying different uncommon packaged foods but these were just - not good. really, not good.

their quality has really, really slid down. if you're really hurting, they'll do the trick if you use a *lot*. i had to use two packs of seeds in the recipe to get the right taste, and i usually use half a pack. however, the exorbitant price makes that completely inefficient. there are *far* better alternatives on amazon right now.

ever since they changed the packaging, they must have changed their sources.

some information:
the last two orders i made that were good were january 28th and february 11th. (actually, i'm still on the fence about the february 11th order.)

i made two orders, one on march 10th and one on march 24th that were equally as disappointing in quality.  the march 10th order was the pack of 4 bags. the march 24th was when i bought the pack of 8 bags (which i tried to cancel, tbh, but it was too late).
i gave them both the benefit of the doubt, and both were shitty.

i believe the expiration date on the crappy orders was 'february 11th 2016', or something, but i threw them all out-- i'm sorry, i looked around to give an exact number, but they're gone.

so, there you have it.
i'm sure many of you are in the same boat.

update:

after resolving to just use this as coconut oil, i got out the jar to make pancakes.  having used almost all of the oil on the top layer, what i found below was separated pulp.

you know what the difference is between any other jar of ""butter"" that separates into oil and pulp, vs coconut butter?

coconut is white.  white coconut oil hardens at room temp, so it doesn't look ""oily"" until it melts.  the layers in a jar of peanut butter or sunbutter are unmistakable.  not so with coconut.

i couldn't see the separation, so i had no idea i needed to heat this jar and stir it before i used it.  that's why it tasted like coconut oil to me instead of a more ""meaty"" butter like what i wanted.  the pulp was on the bottom!

now that i've completely thrown off the oil/protein ratio for this jar, i'm not sure if it's good or not, still!  i can tell you the pulp isn't too sweet, so that's good.

i'll probably have another jar in the future, but for now i'll hold at 3 stars.",HEAT IT AND STIR IT FIRST,1382486400,14.0,,,grocery,a1870

my husband is not a vegan and enjoys all sorts of foods including wraps with various ingredients.  i thought he might enjoy this instead of his usual wrap or as a soup garnish.  he tried it with a couple of different fillings and found  that the fish flavor completely overpowered the taste of any other food.

on opening the sealed bag, the fragrance of raisins is quite pronounced. it's even more prominent than the chocolate or nut scent.

the combination is quite good, although the nuts are not very flavorful. instead of the full creamy flavor of an unroasted cashew, the cashews are quite bland.
the blend has more of a candy and raisin taste as opposed to a nutty taste.

as is the case with most trail mix blends, this is not a low calorie food. the one pound bag contains 15 servings of 140 calories each. 80 of those calories are from fat.

this is an enjoyable energy drink that is a whole lot smoother than some of the other choices.

this is listed as organic cinnamon which is likely the cause for the high price tag. it is slightly higher than most organic cinnamon available here, though it is not outrageously so. that said, if you do not need strictly organic cinnamon, there are definitely less expensive alternatives.

upon opening the container, you're greeted with a very strong, almost flowery fragrance that suggests freshness and quality. it was startling to me when i opened the container because i was not expecting such a strong aroma, even though it is very pleasant. the smell is indicative of how well it flavors foods as well and it carries over when you're cooking - expect it to have more impact than most cinnamon you buy off the shelf. this is one counterweight to the price tag.

this is very excellent cinnamon, with the one drawback of being very expensive. unless you absolutely need organic, there are far less expensive alternatives. even if you do need organic, there are several choices that will cost a little less.",High Quality but More Expensive than Most Organic Cinnamon Containers,1487721600,,,,grocery,a2009

the honey is light in color; i prefer a darker, amber honey but there is nothing inherently wrong with this honey.  the flavor is mild, which i like (in tea), and another thing i think is great is that you are always assured of getting exactly one serving without measuring (so you only get 15 calories instead of 2 or 3 times that many by accident when squeezing a larger honey bottle).

on to what i don't like as much.  the container says all you have to do is ""pop"" open one end while holding the other.  well, it's not so simple.  i held one end and squeezed, bent, and poked the other end with a fingernail -- and couldn't get it open.  i don't have scissors at my desk so i eventually gave up and just punctured the plastic with my staple remover.  it was pretty hard to squeeze the honey out through the small hole generated in this manner.  if you had scissors and removed the entire end, i think the larger opening would facilitate faster flow.  (you can also stir the honey around using the plastic part afterwards instead of getting a spoon dirty.)

yes, i will definitely continue to use these -- there are a lot of benefits.  but i do wish they were easier to open!  3.5 stars.",have several good features but are really hard to open,1402272000,,,{'Package Quantity:': ' 1'},grocery,a2041

sadly, the peach ginger is one of the worst versions of peach ginger tea i've ever tried. it tastes kind of like... nothing. this *can* be a wonderful flavor for tea -- if you're intrigued, try revolution's sweet ginger peach instead. and the raspberry earl grey... sigh. like the peach ginger it's just blah. you'd find much better taste in a $3 box of teabags at any mainstream supermarket.

cumin has an interesting, peppery and complex taste, and while it won't work with everything, i know i can find some good uses for it. even though it's a mediterranean spice, the smell and taste instantly reminded me of tex-mex, likely because i can taste the cumin in chili powder which i definitely associate with that type of cuisine. as such, i started out by using this in some ground beef, blended with a little taco-style seasoning which also contained cumin as an ingredient. the result was a slightly spicier, peppery flavor that was not bad at all. i also used some in a marinade for fish, and it worked terrific in that, bringing out some of the light citrus notes that you can barely taste on its own. it has been interesting experimenting with cumin by itself, without relying up it as a small component of a larger seasoning profile. certainly if one enjoys cumin and uses it for a variety of dishes (or for health purposes), this large container from happy belly, certified organic, is a great option to consider. i will enjoy using this and would recommend.",Ample supply of certified organic cumin,1487203200,,,,grocery,a2106

well, 9 months later, this case too broke like that of the neo hybrid.  the fault this time is the molding around the volume button.  normal wear and tear caused it to break off.  at the same time, the ""rubber"" has become more malleable and soft and has started to tear.  the natural action of putting it in your pants pocket over time has cased the entire rubber to flex easily and cause the entire case to pop off the phone.  nearly every time i put the phone in my pocket, the case pops off even with the simplest action of sitting down.

sorry spigen, 1st time, shame on you.  2nd time, shame on me.  never again will i buy/recommend spigen cases.  not worth their price if they break on you within months.


coming from a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/spigen-sgp-sgp10215-neo-hybrid-case-for-samsung-galaxy-s4-retail-packaging-metal-slate/dp/b00byjxgp2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8"">spigen sgp sgp10215 neo hybrid case for samsung galaxy s4 - retail packaging - metal slate</a>&nbsp;case, i decided to give spigen one last try with this one. originally when i bought my galaxy s4, i initially wanted this case but changed to the neo hybrid at the last minute. since the slim armor is actually cheaper, i wish i would have gotten this one instead.

you see, the problem with the neo hybrid is that the outer frame is fragile. the area usb port is just held together by to small 1 centimeter pieces of plastic. these can and will break over time, basically rendering your case worthless. why do you think that spigen sells these frames as a standalone accessory?? it's not to give you the option of changing the appearance, it's to make you blow more money on the frames because they break!

secondly, the area around the usb port is too small and therefore requiring you to cut the molding around your usb cables if you have standard computer-style usb cables (which are the majority of what i have).

this case seems a lot better than the neo hybrid. the rubber molding is snug and fits around the galaxy s4 super tight.  the openings to all the ports are big enough to where your usb cables/headphones don't need any kind of modifications like that of the neo hybrid. the volume and power buttons are nice and defined (unlike the neo hybrid).

my *only* complaint thus far is that the case itself is slick... super slick. unlike that of the neo hybrid where the majority of the surface was the rubber, you don't have as much of a grip as this one. so be careful!",UPDATE - JUST AS BAD AS OTHER SPIGEN CASES - Better Case Than Neo Hybrid,1381968000,,,"{'Color:': ' SA Smooth White', 'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging'}",cell_phones,a2267

i'm so disappointed, confused, frustrated and most of all, angry!! idiots! the mistake made here could have, and should have been prevented. if that one individual that viewed the order on the monitor, and paid any attention to what he/she was actually doing, i would have received what i actually ordered.

it took me several hours to choose the appropriate bluetooth. i have small ears, so different size lobes are required. i am left ear/handed dominant, so that option was also required. it took me several hours to go through styles, sizes, colors, etc., the list goes on. i received it today, very excited because it's crucial that i have a bluetooth headset for my trip to oregon for my grandfather's funeral. i have exactly 17 people coming to both the house, and funeral home, all to pay their respects. being that i pay yearly for prime membership, i was guranteed to have it delivered by today. i
needed it today! i tracked it every morning to ensure that it would. i'm one of 3 people that know the directions to both places, but what i cannot do is break the law by using my cell phone while driving, nor can i pull off the interstate every time a family member calls asking to confirm directions. i have been through enough, and so has my family. i counted on receiving it today, so what are my chances

i even looked online at photos other people posted (i've yet to figure out how to do this, or post a video, which i do intend to do). none of the contents of what anyone else posted come close to what i got!

so, to recap: i opened my box to a flimsy pair of headphones (brand name ""htc"") that are completely useless because 1) i have 4 pairs of headphones, and am happy with what i have, and 2) this product is completely useless when i need a bluetooth, and will remind that i have no way of keeping in contact with anyone on this trip now, not with a pair of headphones. the headphones aren't even the same brand as the bluetooth i ordered. the headphones are ""htc"", but the bluetooth i ordered are ""anbes"". ""they"" (whoever ""they"" are) even added the ""user manual"" booklet. yet, ""they"" couldn't manage to put the correct product in the box.

edit:  after using this case a few weeks, several drawbacks including one potential serious one became apparent.  the most serious design defect in my opinion is that the plug covering the micro usb port exerts pressure and torque on the charging cable and has the potential to damage your port (i believe it has loosened mine and have charging issues now). if using this case, i'd recommend cutting the plug off, it doesn't do an effective job keeping dust out of the port anyway.  secondly the screen protector lets a lot of dust under it, detracting from the quality of your phone's display.  also the screen protector gets dirty very quickly and is very difficult to effectively clean.  the covers over the buttons make the buttons much less responsive.  lastly the plug covering the headphone hack has the potential to do the same type of damage as the usb plug.  i removed the case and moved on to something else.",Much better options for less money,1445817600,,,"{'Color:': ' Black', 'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging'}",cell_phones,a2312

here's why i gave it even that many stars.  first...it gets one star because the screen protector feels good to touch and really does resist finger prints.  my finger slides easily over the screen... none of that skipping feeling you get from some other screen protectors like zagg.  it gets a second star because it comes with multiple protectors in the pack.

thats where the fun ends, im afraid.  the problems with the screen protector outweigh the advantages.  first, and most notably... the screen protector does not fit the screen for an iphone 6.  it leaves a seam all the way around that is completely unprotected.  some of that unprotected space is covered by my hard case,  but not all of it.  there is about a half inch at the bottom that is uncovered.  with the protector squarely placed in the middle of the phone, it does not even cover the whole actual screen.  there is a sliver of black that is unprotected all the way up both sides.

the second major issue is that there is no cutout for the camera.  you read that right.  the camera is covered up by the screen protector.  have you ever tried to facetime through a screen protector?  doesnt work well.  how am i supposed to take all my selifes?",Leaves phone unprotected but covers camera!!,1413504000,,,,cell_phones,a2405

i'm a bit torn on the smart watch thing all together now that i have one.  it vibrates when i get a text or email but text aren't really easy to reply to.  you talk to text and it doesn't ask you if it has the text correct, it just sends it.  it just doesn't seem to do anything better than my droid turbo 2. and i usually end up taking the turbo 2 on my runs just because i can get pandora and i heart radio and can't get those with the 360 alone.
i unlike others haven't had battery issues, i do only run around 30 minutes because i run steep hills but i seem to get a full day out of the battery with some to spare.  i also like the look of the watch and find the screen awesome.  i love how that when the sun hits it i can still read it really well.
but now to the part that has driven me a bit crazy.  i really wanted an accurate hr monitor.  they touted this watch as a really good hr watch but mine worked terrible.  when i begin my run it seems to work ok but as i come back down the hill i've just run up my pulse goes down on the watch but then doesn't go back up on my next incline.  it actually hovers at around 90 bpm and sometimes drops as i really get my hr going.  i typically reach 170 bpm on the top of the hills that i run.  the monitor doesn't seem to work at all.  i called moto and they had me return the watch and made me wait for a new one. (i had the option of them sending the new one and returning the defective one when the new one came in but they were going to charge me $25.00 for that option..... no thanks)  new watch came in and same exact story hr monitor works identical to the original. i even tried shaving the hair off my wrist to try to improve results, as well as tightening the band and loosening it.  don't know what i am going to do at this point.  i  like the look and the smartwatch features pretty well but it's fairly useless as a fitness watch.  the reason that this is is that most fitness trackers take into account your heart rate and so completley wrong hr info ruins the results.
finally it is only water resistant not water proof.  really????? if i can return it i probably will but seeing that i've had it for a couple of months i probably won't be able to.  would love it if the hr worked and was water proof.

it gives only partial protection though. two chips and a small crack on the corner of my iphone display since i purchased it. this is really a case for someone who wants to protect from scuffs on back and sides.  protection from drops is only partial, and there is virtually no front protection (unless falling to a surface that is perfectly flat) as with some of the heavier otterbox cases. and again, unlike heavier otterbox, there is little to no shock absorption.  so it looks great, but your phone is not as safe as it could be.

this is a case you might use for a nicer social occasion, or in the office, or around the house. if you're getting in and out of a car, or do much walking on sidewalks, rough pavement, etc, go with the otterbox defender, or similar competitor product..","Almost looks like no case at all.

- made of high quality black plastic for its durability.
the plastic is thin but doesn't bend easily.

- precise cutouts for easy access to all controls and functionalities.
i won't say it is precise %100 because the cut out for the rear camera lens isn ot accurate, but it doesn't affect the camera functionality or the flash light. it doesn't bother me.

- the holster is lined with a soft fabric for a scratch free phone.
the screen will be facing the fabric side. nice touch.

- protect your htc one x from scratches, dust, bumps and drops thus providing 100% protection.
this one is not completely true as the phone is exposed from the top and bottom more than the length of the thin cover its self, which exposes it to scratches if it falls from your hand. it is only true if the phone is in its holster, but what's the use of this since most accident happen when you are using the phone not when it is in the holster. however even though the phone is longer than the thin cover, its corners are still kind of protected.
one star out from the review.

- advanced locking mechanism securely holds phone in place. 180-degree swiveling belt blip doubles as an adjustable clip stand
oh boy, here is where this cover lost it with me.
what (advanced) locking mechanism they are talking about? if the phone is in the holster and i turn it upside down, with little shaking the phone slides out of the main holster! one star out because this is false advertisement!
now for the big one, which is my main reason for buying this cover: the belt clip that doubles as stand. i was under impression from seeing the photo where the phone is in its holster but facing outwards that i can use this clip to put the phone on my desk facing me while it is in the holster. the phone when in the shell does not fit inside the holster facing outwards! you need lot of force to slide it but it fits very tightly that if you wanted to remove it from the holster you need both hands and the shell cover will slightly move too, which makes it not practical if you received a phone call and you needed to remove the phone from the holster immediately!
to make things worse, there is a red tag on the holster that reads and i quote (place phone w/shell into holster with display facing inward,toward holster)!!!! if i was living in usa i would send this back immediately to amazon but i live abroad which makes it a hassle. i believe this is false advertisement and amazon should remove that photo from the product photos. two stars out because this was my main purchase reason!

i kept my rating at two stars because i can still use the shell cover only, which is very slim and nice looking and durable to be honest, but there are many other slim covers i could have bought on cheaper price.","Slim shell, but no way to use it in holster facing outwards!",1341360000,,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51e8n8twIAL._SY88.jpg'],,cell_phones,a2414

unfortunately this is one of those products, its okay but with a few defects  and i cant recommend this product it is not very good imo.  4 things i always look for in a case/cover protector is
1. probably most important i need grip!  this out of all the above is an absolute deal breaker, and also what i have trouble finding most.  with the increasing size of smartphones these days having a thin case, with good grip for one handed use is almost a must. i am very active so having a case that will allow me to hold the phone with one hand is vital to me.
2. case has to cover as much of the back and sides of the phone as possible.  this one does and the cut outs are fine, but the power button must not be lined up correctly because it is near impossible to press with case installed.
3. i am not big on style exactly so a case doesnt really need to change the look of my phone but is nice if it gives my phone a nice sleek look, and this one is sleek but not a game changer in the style department.
4. i like to have my case be as thin as possible yet still provide decent protection if drop which this one does as most tpu cases can.  have to have a case that doesnt add too much bulk to already huge screen phones.

pros:
1. great coverage of back and sides for protection, cut outs line up perfect.
2. pretty thin, doesnt add much bulk.
3. plain but sleek and stylish enough
cons:
1. made my screen protector bubble up on sides
2. very slippery all over, if you are looking to add a grippy feel stay away from this one

the rear button placement is actually very handy. i can't speak highly enough of the on screen controls, less accidental button pressing.

tap twice to awake the screen. still trying to get used to my phone now (note4) not having this feature.

i've owned many phones so i can pretty much grade on a case by case basis. i purchased this to replace my iphone 6. everyone always talked about how the g4 was going to be the best phone yet, however, i feel as though it's a hunk of junk. it's not worth it.

the charger had to be replaced 2 times, in store since i had the phone (7 days)

the phone continuously dropped calls, no matter how good the signal. i could never get signal. the sound coming from the other party was static, almost like they were on an am radio station. same complaints on the other end of the phone. tried another unit as was in my 15 day return period. the loudspeaker for media and speakerphone broke. the leather faded inside of a normal case. just shoddy workmanship. i returned it and got a note4 and couldn't be happier with my choice.

updated as of 06/12/15:
i like how people assume that i'm a fanboy of apple. clearly, they haven't had their phones long enough to experience glitches, or maybe 2 units i was unlucky with. i talked to a vzw rep to troubleshoot my phone, and he said he had the exact same problems and went for the note4. i took his advice and couldn't be happier myself. ask the people you're talking to, if they hear static or you're breaking up while you're talking to them. chances are, they're going to say yes.

as for the s4, read my review on that. i loved the s5. i loved the note 2 and the note 3 and the note 4. i'm getting notifications on other reviews now because of this review. i'm not a fanboy of either, but i'm stating my opinion, as is what the site wants you to do. if it helped you, great, but so what if you're not having issues. i don't need to hear it. to me, this phone was not worth it. lg could have done so much better, and realistically, they didn't. the finish of the phone (leather) is dyed this way. it's not even actual leather, and cost more off contract then the note 4 did. it seems that they (lg) focused more on the design of the phone rather than how good it worked. the g2/3 were great, but they really screwed up on this one. the car charger that i purchased for this phone said when connected: plug in charger that you got with the phone, unsupported charger! another gimmick to make you buy more accessories lg branded.","Eh, not as good as one could expect",1433894400,9.0,,,cell_phones,a2452

the thing that i really don't like at all is the texture of the hard plastic outer shell.  the colored shell is very slippery.  because of the slippery nature of the colored plastic, the phone is very hard to grasp securely.  i'm always afraid that when i go to pick the phone up, after it has been sitting on a desk or table, i am going to drop it.

this case, for me, does not instill a feeling of security while holding the phone.  the colored hard outer shell needs to have a rubber grip along both sides below the power and volume rocker.  this design would provide something sticky rather than slippery to assist grasping the phone when lifting it from a table or desk -  or even while holding the phone during use.  i would then give it 5 stars.

let's face it, unless you are buying this just to change the appearance of the phone, it is supposed to provide protection for your expensive device.  why would any manufacturer make a case that could actually help you drop your phone.

after i removed this case from my phone, i felt that the naked phone actually had more grip than with the case.

the spigen ""bounce"" or otterbox ""commuter"" are both much better cases if you want something that feels secure and grippy in your hand.

because a case is supposed to help protect your phone, not help you drop and damage your device, i can only give the slim armor case 2 stars.  it looks really nice, but grippyness is lacking.",Slippery When Dry!,1388793600,,,"{'Size:': ' onesize', 'Color:': ' SA Dodger Blue', 'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging'}",cell_phones,a2455

cons: not as advertised.  and complicated to use.
- does not have 2.1mah output as advertised.  test it!  plug a powered down, emptied battery galaxy s7 edge to this battery pack, the s7e will tell you that it will take 3hrs 20 minutes to fully charge.  do the same with a 2mah power adapter and the s7 edge will tell you that it will only take 2hrs 8minutes to fully charge.  this is a lie from the manufacture.  i completely lose trust with this manufacturer.
- why not automatically charge a device when a device is connected?
- why all the complicated procedures with charging in single-wire, double-wire, etc.?  why the need for toggling between charging modes with power button quick push, push-hold 3s, etc?  why do you expect me to know all that and remember all that?  why not add a tiny bit more smart to detect a charging mode.

i chose to go with this tempered glass screen protector due to the hi-res screen on the g4. when i opened the package and compared the contents to the directions, they didn't match up... and therein lies the flaw. in one step of the directions, it stated to clean the phone with the special tape enclosed. there was no tape but there was an alcohol pad. i thought, i'll just substitute it, and also clean my fingers with it after i wash my hands. i followed the directions to the t, only substituting the alcohol pad for the tape, and being sure the alcohol completely dried before installing the protector. not getting my own tape was a mistake. there was a sizable piece of debris on the screen even after cleaning it, which created a bubble i couldn't squeegee out. so, i removed the protector to try and remove the piece of debris, which not only was i unable to do, but i created a linty, smeary mess on the adhesive. when i reapplied it, it was terrible, so i removed it and stuck it back in the box. looks like i blew the cost of the screen protector. it looked like it would be awesome! word of caution... if your package says use tape, and there's none in the packaging... don't skip getting up and getting some!

one other observation... in the past, on the tech skin,  there was a cut out for the front facing camera. this tempered glass didn't have that. only one for the ear speaker. i was a little skeptical about how that'd work, seeing as there was always a cut out in the past.","Nice protector, wish I could have utilized it. **READ ME!**",1434067200,,,,cell_phones,a2484

i like the minimalistic look of this case. so happy it does not have the apple show off hole or any brand logo. it is quite thin and slim and has a very nice feel. the texture is soft, but not slippery.  i think it should offer decent protection if dropped, but have no experience with this.  i already had a tempered glass screen protector so i can't comment on that.

the kickstand works fine. when not in use it snaps unobtrusively into the back.  it is a bit delicate, so not sure if it will hold up.

here's the biggest problem: the silicone cover is very thin, which helps prevent the case from being too bulky, however it is also extremely flimsy.  the fit at the bottom of the phone where the ports and speakers are located is very loose. the hard shell peice only covers the corners of the bottom, so the case offers very minimal protection there.

overall i like the case, but i'm not at all confident the areas around the ports will hold up. this is a big deal that could have been addressed by the manufacturer, so for this reason i am withholding 2 stars. if not for this, i would call it perfect.","Nice case, with one huge flaw",1420761600,,,{'Color:': ' Black / Red'},cell_phones,a2555

cons:  for some reason, i drop my phone more when i use this case.  i never drop my phone while using other cases.  i think it's because when i fold the flimsy front cover over, i don't get a firm grasp on the phone.  either way, after i dropped my phone today for the third time (while using this case), i decided to trash the case.","Professional-looking case, just make sure you hold your phone firmly!",1426032000,,,,cell_phones,a2559

the charging feature, though, while slow, is awesome and useful. it eliminates the need for separate spare batteries to charge by, and helps keep your phone juiced up on the go. there's an autostop aspect to the charging, so you don't have to worry about the charging in the case itself wearing down when you don't need it to.

i have the teal/white case, though i would call this more of a light turquoise kind of color than teal. it's a pastel more than anything, but it's a pretty color, and helps the phone case stand out to find it easily.

as for how well the case actually protects, i didn't do any big tests, but it is a sturdy case. mostly, though, i think the charging feature is slower than expected, and i wish it offered screen protection.","No screen protection, and this case doesn't want to open easily",1430265600,,,"{'Size:': ' One Size', 'Color:': ' aqua/white', 'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging'}",cell_phones,a2560

while it seems very practical to have all of your ids and credit cards, and things together with your phone, and a protective case all in one, it's kind of more of a pain than anything. think about how big and bulky of something do you want attached to your phone, as you are holding it next to your face. think about the fact that all your ids and cards are exposed at the same time, out in the open for someone to see or snatch.

what it boils down to for most people, is you will find yourself removing the phone from case quite often to talk on it. well what good is a protective case if you have to remove it to talk on the phone? it's no good. the case is really just too bulky and cumbersome to use the phone with it in there. texting and surfing is ok, but talking on it is annoying. and to remove the phone is not super easy either. it's not hard, but it's not something you want to do several times a day.

if all this sounds ok to you, you might be interested in the quality. the quality is fine. the leather is thick and strong. the stitching looks nice. overall it is relatively nice case/wallet. not high dollar, but adequate for the $$. it should last 6 mos to a year, like a wallet would. although most people use their phone more than their wallet, so it's lifetime may be shorter. once the phone is inside the case, and wallet is closed, you can drop the phone on rocks and it will not break. so it does what it is suppose to, but only when the case is closed, and the phone is actually inside of it.

the case is just really not practical for most people. you will probably be looking for something else shortly after you purchase this one. so think carefully about everything i said before you buy this. if you think you will be ok with this type of setup for your phone, then go ahead and get one for yourself. i think the idea is good, but it's just not practical for most people.",Not the ideal setup for your smart phone,1466208000,10.0,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7164YMhN2rL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yaS5oiHTL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wSV0HCJzL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JzbwAb1RL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RlqVOFfiL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pnfeNxYjL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pnfeNxYjL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71g8tXT5wsL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OrlnCie7L._SY88.jpg']",{'Color:': ' Black'},cell_phones,a2593

the first two things i noted - lots of pixelation.  the second thing, is that the pixelation didn't really ruin the experience.  it was far more immersive than i had anticipated.

i use glasses for close up things, so i couldn't get it focused well without them, and it was quite a pain to wear with them on.  that is part of why the lower rating.  they say this is designed to make it easier to wear most glasses, and mine are pretty small, just readers, but it still was difficult getting on and off, and then limited the experience.  if you don't wear glasses, this is probably a 4 star item for you then.

alright, so vr isn't that close to ""reality"" yet, but man, it's enough to be immersive.  the tracking was very impressive.  even just some of the ""rooms"" for the menus were impressively done.  and since i was using this with no controller, while it took a bit to get used to the swiping and touch controls on the side of the head gear, the thought that went into the engineering is actually really well done.  it was very easy to move through things, select things, and back up a level in the menus with the hard button on top of the touch areas.  i would imagine the experience would be even more enjoyable then with a game controller so you wouldn't have to keep reaching up to touch the side of the unit, but it really didn't detract that much.

watching the videos and such with it, looking down in the forest and seeing ""down"" as well as the same immersion for the rock climbing video - despite the pixelation and making it seem lower resolution, it maintained a feeling of immersion that was just amazing for this tiny little device.

the pass-through camera was a lot of fun, trying to navigate around the building, through hallways, you look and feel like you're a bit drunk since there is a bit of separation of your view of things, and their actual location.  so i found myself walking out with hands brushing objects, but even then, myself and others who played with it tend to wobble a bit, like being tipsy.

i have to say, for the price, the experience is worth it.  i wish it wasn't limited to just the galaxy devices, then i could've kept it for myself, but since i use an iphone, i ended up passing it to the coworker who let me use his phone.

if it weren't for the pixels being so blatant, and the issues wearing glasses despite their claim, it would easily be 5 stars for the experience.  and as i said, if you don't wear glasses, it's an easy 4 star device.  if you've ever wondered, just get it.  for this price, it's a steal.  even though far from perfect, the experience is amazing and fun.","Actually was more immersive than I had expected, but still not great with glasses",1463097600,,,{'Format:': ' Wireless Phone Accessory'},cell_phones,a2603

i switched from the iphone 4 to lumia 920 so if you're in the same situation and deciding whether to try a different os/phone hopefully this review aids you in making a decision.

i've been an iphone user for a few years now starting from the 3gs and upgrading to the iphone 4. i skipped the 4s in anticipation of the iphone 5 but for me, it didn't seem like too big of a change (played with my brother's iphone 5 for a bit) so i ended up keeping the ip4. the ip4 did everything that i wanted in a smartphone; i am not a heavy user but used it for your basic text, email, web/media browsing, and used a handful of apps, along with a jailbreak to customize certain features. but i was itching to try something new and the lumia 920 piqued my interest.

since i'm into dslr photography the pureview camera and optical stabilization intrigued me. i've done a few test shots and overall, the quality is great, especially with low light capture, and the optical stabilization is a great feature. as of now (nov. 14, 2012) there is some talk of soft photos but nothing extreme, and it seems that nokia is working on a software update to fix this issue. the half-press of the camera button engages auto focus and the optical stabilization kicks in, just like a dslr, so usability is excellent. you can also adjust certain settings such as iso and ev for more creative control.

the overall build quality is superb, but with nokia, that's pretty standard. the screen is bright and beautiful and watching hd content is a pleasure. the matte finish of the black feels great and looks sophisticated, but of course for the more adventurous there are more color options to choose from. the main critique of the phone was it's weight and coming from the ip4, it basically feels the same. of course, if you're comparing it the ip5 or some of the other smartphones it may feel a lot heavier. personally, i like having the weight as it feels more comfortable to hold and use. your mileage may vary, but honestly, the weight issue is completely overblown.

i was a little worried about the feel of the user interface on windows phone 8 after using ios all these years. but after trying it out, it was pretty much second nature since the general feel and ui is similar to ios. the customizable live tiles are great for organizing your home screen and keeping you up to date with what you want (and removing things you don't want.) the overall windows phone 8 os is super smooth and quick compared to what i was use to on my ip4, which i already thought was nice and quick. i'm sure that there may be a few nitpicks and features not yet included that may bother certain users and for me, that one feature is the lack of a notification center. it seems that microsoft couldn't include it in time and hopefully they'll push out an update that'll add this feature.

the one thing about switching to the windows platform that may bother users is of course app selection. it really isn't as bad as others make it out to be though and i would say that 90% of the main apps found on ios/android are found on the microsoft store. some apps may not be as fully featured (yet) but hopefully with the push of the windows 8 ecosystem developers will start concentrating more on this platform. as i've read, developers are liking how easy it is to work on the platform so i wouldn't be surprised if in the near future the microsoft marketplace will become just as robust as it's competitors. if all you download are gaming apps, then i would say that the apple store definitely has the edge right now. the apple store does has a lot of junk apps, but if you're looking for variety, the microsoft marketplace still falls behind in that category at the moment. personally i don't do a whole of gaming so that doesn't bother me but it may bother others. for any other app, they'll most likely be found on the windows platform or there'll be a similar app that performs the same functions (and may even be better.)

i haven't used the nokia music player too much but one glaring feature missing is the ability to scan through a song; you can only fast forward. this can be a deal breaker for some who like to use their smartphone as their sole music player. but other than that, controls are intuitive and the user interface is very solid.

some final points about the phone; the wireless charging is a great feature. since i always lay my phone down on my computer desk, i can now just plop it down on the charging plate on the desk and it'll charge without fiddling with any cables. sure it would only takes a few quick seconds to plug a cable in but it's small features like this that add to the phone. battery life is decent and a full day with normal text, email, web/video browsing, and gaming use i'll be at around 40%. in standby i don't notice the battery draining super quick. there does seem to be some complaints right now of battery drainage but i haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary. since i'm still new to the phone and constantly playing with it, i'm sure the battery usage can be better if i just used it normally.

if you are heavily into the apple ecosystem it may be a bit tougher to change to a different platform. but the iphone 4 was my only apple product so the switch wasn't troublesome by any means. in the end, i have no regrets in changing from the iphone 4 to the lumia 920. sure there may be a few things missing but nothing that i can't adjust to and nothing bad enough to not warrant a review less than five stars. it's a superb phone with an equally amazing os and using it is a pleasure. silky smooth, great handling, and easy usability. microsoft has the resources to make this platform work so i'm not too worried about updates, etc. i also remember my first mobile phone being the nokia 5110 which was pretty much the equivalent of the iphone back in the day (in terms of popularity.) nokia makes great products so i'm not worried about the reliability or quality. hopefully more users step out of their comfort zones to try something different. i'm glad i did and do not regret my decision at all.

*update (11/25/2012)*
i've owned this phone since launch and after using it daily for 2 weeks i have to downgrade my review from 5 stars to 4 stars. the main problem as reported by others is the battery. the first day or two after launch i had no problem with battery drainage. but after a while, i noticed random significant battery drainage during idle. sometimes i would lose up to 20% in one hour without any change in settings or apps. i tried turning off some features such as nfc, wi-fi, etc. but the random battery drainage would continue. checking the battery setting, i would sometimes get around 15 hours of battery time remaining at 100% and sometimes at around 70% i'll get 11 days of remaining battery time. it seems all over the place.

also, sometimes while charging the battery, it would randomly stop charging. on one occasion i left the phone plugged into the usb charger overnight and when i woke up it was below 10% since it had stopped charging. another time i used the wireless charger and it did the same thing. i also noticed that the back of the phone would sometimes get abnormally hot while using it and/or charging. i'm aware that using the phone and/or charging can put a load on the battery but it got uncomfortably warm, something i never encountered while using my iphone 4.

another thing are the live tiles. they're great but seem to work randomly. i know that certain apps only update in certain intervals but the oem loaded weather channel app doesn't seem to update anymore until i go into the app. i had no problems with the app for the first week or so and haven't changed any settings regarding that app so i have no idea what could be wrong with it.

there seems to be some problems with the overall os/firmware that needs to be addressed at this point. i would give it 3.5 stars if i could. fortunately i have access to a battery charger during my day to day use so i can charge it when i need to, but if you rely on having long battery life without the option of being able to readily charge it, it could be a problem. i really hope nokia/microsoft push out an update that fixes this issue soon.

*update (12/03/2012)*
just another update. it's been about a month since i've been using the phone and i still love it. after letting the battery discharge completely once, the battery performance seems to be better and more consistent. i did have one random reboot but generally speaking, in my day to day use, i haven't had any problems. i've gotten so use to the smoothness and speed of the os that when i sometimes use my iphone 4 it just doesn't feel like it reacts as quickly. i did originally dock a star after i noticed the battery problems but have bumped it back up since it seems to have stabilized. there are still a handful of apps that i'd love developers to put more effort into or create on the wp8 platform, but for most things i've find other apps or workarounds.

i still don't have any regrets on this phone purchase and will update if i have anything else to add.

*update (06/27/2013)*
so it's been over half a year and i'm still using and enjoying my lumia 920. over time, there's been a few updates and a lot of official apps are starting to hit the marketplace making the user experience better. i'm still eagerly waiting for the windows phone blue update later in the year/next year which should bring a lot good features such as double-tap to wake, fm radio, and hopefully a notification center. still, at this point in time, my experience using wp8 has overall been good having switched from using ios for 5+ years.

however, just the other day my lumia 920 developed a vertical cyan line running down the left-hand side of the screen. it seems that several other users have had this problem occur, although they reported it much sooner after buying the phone. i'm sure i could send it out to nokia but having the downtime is too much of a hassle. for now i'll have to live with it and since new lcd's are going for around $50 i may just go ahead and replace it on my own if it gets to be too much of an annoyance. nevertheless, i'm disappointed. i know problems can occur but all the previous smartphones i've owned had no problems within the 2-year contract i usually sign up for and to have this phone malfunction within half a year leaves a bad taste.

*update (02/12/14)*
there's been a lot of updates to windows phone and the latest updates have added some nice features such as ""glance"", ""double-tap"" to wake, etc. the upcoming 8.1 update that'll include a notification center and quick settings should make the os overall much more solid. after a year and a half the os has progressed nicely. a lot of apps have been releasing and that void is still filling up nicely. although, there is still a lack of good support from all developers as ios and android still get priority in terms of features.

i still feel that wp8 is a great os and it's evolving nicely but i've personally been aching to switch back to ios. the breaking point is pretty much that the lumia 920's camera has now malfunctioned, causing a black screen with unresponsive buttons. a hard reset has done nothing so now the only option would be to get it fixed/replaced. the camera was one of the main selling points of getting this phone so it's a shame. with only a few months left on contract and a slew of new phones coming out, i've pretty much decided to switch back to ios or try android at this point. like i've mentioned before, i've had no problems with my previous smartphones (iphone 3gs and 4) but in the close to two years of owning this nokia, the lcd screen has failed and now the camera. i know there'll be a few more manufacturer choices if i wanted to stay with wp8 (samsung and sony should have wp8 phones soon), but nokia is suppose to be the high-end and all these problems leave a bad impression.

i've docked a star, making the original 4-star to a 3-star rating for the lumia 920 because of these problems. it was fun while it lasted and maybe down the road i'll try windows phone again since it really is a solid os.","Solid smartphone, smooth OS *2014 UPDATE*",1352851200,80.0,,{'Color:': ' Black'},cell_phones,a2606

i have a blackberry and my wife has a verizon phone (not sure of the model; i'll update later) and both of us can easily hook up or devices to it, quickly and cleanly.

the only problem i've had so far is difficulty understanding anyone using its speaker capabilities.  this could be me and my 43-year old ears, or it could be the fact that i often speak to people who are on bad cell phones with bad connections because we live in the mountains, but i have difficult actually hearing what has been said.  i say ""what?"" frequently, or ask people to restate something from a point because it's simply not clear.  the device seems solid enough, but i generally end up turning off the bluetooth connection in favor of the cellphone so that i can complete the conversation.

compared with other reviewers, i'd say that i am in the severe minority when it comes to this problem, so please consider that if you are thinking of buying it.  the price is very reasonable, the battery life is phenomenal; really this is a first class unit... i just have trouble using it for the most important aspect of having a bluetooth.  the only thing i can suggest is considering a headphone bluetooth if, like me, your hearing isn't perfect or if you're getting older (also like me!) and don't want to keep your cell phone in your hand any more while using it.

i'm very careful with my devices. never had a bad drop. never broke a screen. i think i'll stick with the spigen and other thinner cases for this already-huge phone. i was never this picky with pervious (smaller) phones but i just hate to add any mass whatsoever to this beast.

the 801247 kit is easy to set up. in fact, it took me longer to get it out of the packaging than it did to set it up. i used the option of attaching it to the inside of a window that faces towards the nearest cellphone tower. the was quite a distance from my desk, but the 50 feet of cable wilson provides is up to the task. it is great to have it in two lengths in case you don't need to go as far, but i am glad then included a cable connector so that i could use the full length. i plugged the cable into the desktop unit, attached the antenna and plugged it in.

bam! the bars on my phone went from the normal 1 (or two if i'm lucky)  to the maximum! i now get a steady, strong signal. i walked around my office and the strength only started dropping off when i was about 15 feet from the transmitter -- impressive. calls are clear and seem louder than before and i don't get the audio ""cut-outs"" that i used to.

pros:
+ low tech; no batteries, and best of all - no extra cables or wires!  hurray!
+ easy to use; you can put your phone in with one hand
+ easy to mount; suction cup actually sticks and the vent mount (which i use) is super easy to figure out yet holds securely
+ will hold several different phones / nav systems / ipods (though it won't amplify them) - including droid x.  it's a nice and handy way to keep your toys safe but convenient while you're driving.
+ it does amplify the iphone 4... somewhat.  this is a powerless system - kind of like using a megaphone i guess - so don't expect a big difference.

cons:
- sound amplification is pretty nominal, and the sound itself is tinny.  i actually prefer to use my car's bluetooth for the sound per se, but i still like the mount to hold my phone conveniently.

i had a bit of frustration getting the soft rubbery textured grip fame to cling to the edges of the metal frame. it took me about ten minutes, which is too long. the raised bevel around the perimeter is good for extra shock resistance and the screen protector is scratch resistant although not very resistant against sharp objects. the metal frame has two ports that have water plugs  the charging port and the headphone port. these are water-proof but if you want to listen to music or charge your iphone, you need to be away from any water.

the grip is tight and the buttons that work your volume, power and ringer are exposed enough to make for easy use. the bottom line is its not that great looking, but if you close all ports it will be waterproof. the price is a bit high for this kind of device, but if you are careful, it will protect your iphone from water. product supplied for review.",Works Well If All The Plugs Are Closed,1432080000,15.0,,,cell_phones,a2738

when you see the picture is what you get. you get a mini-usb on one side of the approximately one-inch flexible cable, with a lightning adapter on the other side. in the box, the key ring is separate from the charger; you simply hook them together and you're in business.

a few additional observations:
1. charging with this device vs. a regular cable. i found that when charging my iphone from 0%, the charge went up to 10% in 20 minutes vs. 10% in 15 minutes with a normal lightning chord.
2. this may not work that great in a car/truck/van with a charger not located near a platform on which to rest your device. in that case, it's left to dangle due to the short chord length. however, if your car charger is located next to a flat surface, this should work perfectly.

i am updating my review after being contacted by kay's technologies, who sells the kayscase line of iphone cases.  i have left my initial review below as reference.

the company left a comment on my amazon review, apologizing for any inconveniences and offering a replacement case.  we have had three different correspondences via e-mail, and they have stated that they did not realize that there was a slight defect in their original shipping products until the first round of negative reviews came in.  within a month of this product hitting the amazon storefront, kay's technologies has stated that they have dropped all of the old/defective cases out of inventory and replaced them with the newly redesigned cases.

i received my replacement case at no charge.  it looks identical to the original case, but the newly redesigned case came in a proper retail packaging similar to what you would find hanging in the store at best buy or radio shack.  the original case came in cheap plastic bags as packaging, so this new packaging material gives a considerable sens of ""worth"" to their products.

the new case fixes the issues that made the original case unusable.  the width of the case was increased slightly, so that it's snug enough that you know it'll never slip off, but it's not so small that the iphone struggles to fit into it.  the original design would have popped off if the phone when dropped, just because the case was stretched too far and didn't quite fit onto the phone.  there is also a slight ""lip"" inside the walls of the newly designed case so that it actually snaps into place.  the sides of the case extends past the front face of the phone enough to keep the glass from scratching onto the table top when placed face down.  these plastic sides of the case extend a bit around the bottom and top of the phone, but do not fully encompass the top and bottom so that the edges of the iphone are exposed.  however, the button-area has a good cutout for access to the volume buttons while retaining the edge/lip of the plastic case, so the only portions without an edge are the topmost and bottom-most parts.  the overall size of the case has been matched perfectly to the iphone 5 so that there aren't any awkward gaps of empty spaces in the corners.

all in all, the case has been designed perfectly to fit the phone!  it's a very minimal case that won't add weight or bulk to your phone.  other companies are selling variations of the same design.  in fact, you can walk into best buy and purchase a rocketfish designed case that is similar to this version, but those rocketfish cases cost anywhere between $25-30.  skinit sells their iphone 5 lenu cases that are identical to this, but at an exorbitant price of $35.  unfortunately, skinit's case doesn't provide an edge/lip in crucial places and leaves your phone open for dings and scratches on its edges.  for 1/3 of the price, this kayscase hardskin cover case is a great choice for an iphone 5!

by the way, i appreciate the great customer service from kay's technologies.  they contacted me when they saw my issue, didn't hassle me when providing me with a replacement case, and followed up via e-mail to see if i was satisfied.  i would recommend this company wholeheartedly if they were to treat all of their customers in the same manner.

~~~original review as of september, 2012~~~
kasycase offered their iphone cases at 85% off retail price when pre-ordered.  i was extremely pleased with the delivery, since they came through on their promise to have the case delivered on launch day for the iphone 5.  however, there are two major issues with this case.  the height isn't perfect; you'll find a gap of about 1-2 millimeters on the top and bottom of the case corners.  you'll also find that the depth of the case isn't satisfactory.  the case is meant to clip onto the iphone 5, but it scratches onto the volume/mute keys since the fit is so tight, and it never really clips into place because either the left-to-right width is too small, or the width (back-to-front) is too small.  in effect, you have a case that stretches out to try to clip onto your phone, but it never really makes it all the way around to give you the wrap-around lip that you want on the front of your phone; as in, if you put your phone face-down onto a desk, the glass on the front of the phone will touch the desk.  kayscase offers a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/kayscase-slim-soft-skin-cover-case-for-apple-new-iphone-5-2012-version-screen-protector-frost-clear/dp/b008og89ve/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8"">kayscase slim soft skin cover case for apple new iphone 5 2012 version, screen protector (frost clear)</a>&nbsp;case that's actually perfect and great for the value.  get the soft skin case instead of this one.  they may fix their manufacturing process in the future, but the current shipping versions of this case does not fit the iphone 5 correctly.",EDITED: Redesigned case works!

1. the color

2. the price tag (at some stores)

there are no new features in the black razr.  it has all the same specs (and bugs) as the silver model.

in choosing a razr you should consider which color you like best, and whether or not you're willing to pay the price premium some stores are charging on the black one.

you should also read the reviews for the silver model, since both phones are the same inside.

a couple of other notes:

-the keyboard on the black razr is silver.  some people do not like this.

-the razr (probably the silver one only) is rumored to be coming to another us carrier very soon (hint: starts with ""t"", ends with ""obile"")

-there will be a lot of new sharp looking phones with features superior to the razr coming out this fall.",Public Service Announcement - Differences between Black and Silver RAZR,1120435200,259.0,,,cell_phones,a2839

=== the good stuff ===

* the phone is a snug fit into the case, in fact it is a slight challenge to get the phone in and out of it. at 1.6 ounces, it doesn't add much weight or bulk to the phone, and the styling looks professional.

* empty, the case is fairly stiff, and even more so when the phone is inside it. the side panels are not easy to deflect away from the case, and certainly stay in position if the phone is placed face down and slid across a surface. they are sufficiently raised over the screen height to provide decent scratch protection. the four corners seem to have a good amount of material, so there is at least some drop shock protection.

* the buttons and jacks all functioned normally, and there was no problem plugging in cables to the headphone or power cord. the microphone and camera interfaces were not encumbered by the case.

* the back side of the case is mostly covered in a rather smooth ""vinyl type"" material. while it does have some texture, it is not the sort of material that every bit of dust, lint or dirt clings to.

=== the not-so-good stuff ===

* the thick walls of the side panels make reaching the mute button a bit of a trick. i was able to get it with the tip of my fingernail, but a bit of a struggle. i have ""average"" fingers-if yours are much bigger this may be a trouble spot.

* the case is a bit ""slippery"" in my hand, and since it is relatively smooth, the phone felt a bit like it wanted to slip out of my hand. that has never happened, but it does feel a bit uncomfortable.

=== summary ===

this seems like a very nicely designed case, and a good choice if protection is your number one criteria for a phone case. i didn't try dropping the case with the phone, but it at least gives some confidence of protection.

now for the galaxy note 3 tech armor ballastic screen protector. i have no complaints! it is easy to install, due to the fact of the screen protector is harder and firm than the film material. instructions was very clear. the package came with a wipe cleaning solution, microfiber cloth which i thought was a bit cheap, dust removal tape, bubble remove card and one black and one white home button sticker. i usually like to turn on my desk light to be able to see any dust on the screen which works well, it took around 30 mins to install because i was being picky about dust and the alignment of the screen protector. afterwards, i use my hand and bubble remove card to remove any bubbles, i couldn't remove some spots, maybe i still had tiny dust in certain areas but it was not so bad it will annoy me, which i usually get annoyed while installing film since it is more visible. i like the feel of the screen protector due to it is glass like, so it is smooth and no roughness and crystal clear. i will buy this product again, especially for my galaxy note 4. the screen protector fits perfect onto the galaxy note 3, it does not interfere with the front facing camera, and i use the black home button sticker to make it easier to press. one dislike is the home button sticker has a square image logo, like for the iphone, which is a turn off because i'm using a samsung galaxy note 3, i wish tech armor will remove the image and just make it plain black or white for future packages.

i hope the lifetime warranty is true and forever! by the way, package comes in a nice box and a seal sticker so it is tech armor certified.

tip: be sure to follow the instructions, wash your hands with soap to prevent dust, oil and before installation, don't touch anything else or move anything which can create dust in the air. take your time!!","Superb ballastic glass screen protector for any mobile phone, especially Galaxy Note 3,4,5!",1447545600,,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TshzEY2qL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719hBJooJRL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mgNxd+SdL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TanY9I7nL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MCeWB0pVL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Oi7V9-RcL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710IxCNOp0L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71iSVj29+nL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xE02ScQ4L._SY88.jpg']",,cell_phones,a2924

cons: no installation instructions in the package; as with all glass protectors, you only get one shot at installing it correctly - the adhesive is not reuseable (but read on to learn how to get it right the first time).

be warned: this protector does not include any application instructions, but here's what to do:

not wanting the crooked installation i had with a previous glass protector, i googled for advice and found the ""hinge"" method on youtube.  basically, before peeling the backing off the adhesive, get the protector lined up perfectly and put some scotch tape (painter's tape, masking tape, or similar non-marring, non-residue tape) along one edge so that the screen protector now swings like a door on hinges on the phone.  when you're satisfied that the alignment is perfect, ""open"" the door, clean the phone's screen thoroughly, make sure there is no dust on the screen, peel the backing off the adhesive, and ""close"" the door.  perfect installation that anyone can do.  as mentioned, youtube has some videos showing this excellent method of installing glass screen protectors.

with the protector perfectly aligned, it is barely perceptible.  you might be the only one who realizes that there's a screen protector installed on your phone.  it is very nearly invisible and, as noted earlier, does not impair any features or functions of the phone.  touchid, proximity sensor, and the front-facing facetime camera all work perfectly woth this protector installed.

the fit and finish of this particular protector is comparable to the expensive name brands, but is delivered to your door at bargain-basement prices.  in fact, you can buy two of these for the price of one of the least-expensive name-brand.  the quality of this protector is excellent!

once you go with a real glass screen protector, you'll never want to go back to the ""traditional"" vinyl or plastic ones ever again.  not even the highest quality film protector has the look or feel of real glass on your phone.

all told, i could not be any happier with this purchase and would happily to buy it again.",Fantastic!,1390348800,52.0,,,cell_phones,a2954

so this ball comes with instructions i've not seen on a yoga ball before:  it says to inflate it the first day, then deflate it to 50% 24 hours later, then inflate again to capacity desired (just as always, don't overfill).  the rationale given is that the material of the ball won't fully expand under the first inflation and that this will allow it to do so.  i followed these instructions.

it would be more accurate to say, however, that i didn't need to deflate it the full 50% because it was already a good chunk of the way there...on it's own.  even my daughter commented on it, because the decrease in size in a 24 hour period was considerable.  after inflating it back up again, it is retaining air a bit better.  it still has deflated more then i would have preferred to see.  i mean. it's taken months for my regular yoga ball to deflate that much (it's a different brand) and my son bounces on that thing like it's a trampoline daily.  holds one side of the front entry way gate, and bounces his bottom up and down on that thing with enough force to leave a good foot of air space between him and the ball.  so he's not been gentle on that ball, and it took months to show any dramatic lessoning of the air level.

for this ball, it's noticeable after a couple of days with much less use.  the upper body strength stuff is harder for him to do, so he did try it, because it's a position he totally loves, but he tires quickly, so this hasn't seen hard and heavy action.  and he hasn't been bouncing on it, because it's not really as conducive to big air as the other ball.  and he likes his bounces big.  so, no bounces.  minimal sitting, not a lot of use, and more noticeable deflating.

for me, it becomes an issue of time.  when you have a child who has as many developmental delays as mine does, you're busy as heck.  and finding time to refill this a few times a week isn't something i find desirable.  it's survivable, but i would prefer if it retained air better.  so this is a product that some people seemed very happy with, a couple of other people have reported deflating issues, so this may be a problem with the product you yourself are likely to encounter at this point in time.

06/28:  so, after less then two months of use, and showing no signs of visible damage, this thing exploded today with my son on it.  he was bouncing on it, but not vigorously. from my perspective, we have a yoga ball of a different brand that he's been way, and i mean way more vigorous with, and that thing has never exploded. he has a cheap, thin walled ball from wal-mart that's not even a yoga ball and isn't designed to be bounced on that he's had for over a year now, bounces on it all the time.  it's not even deflating, and again, no exploding.  i've attached a picture of the exploded ball.  he did hit the ground hard enough to end up crying, which is saying something to me about how hard he hit.  part of me is glad he at least felt it, because there was a time because of his sensory issues where deep impact things he didn't notice so much, and that was scary in and of itself.  but i'm not a big fan of anything that can hurt my little man whether he feels it or not, so i'm downgrading this one, and getting him a different brand, because between the deflating and the exploding, at this point, i unfortunately can't recommend this one.",Deflate-Gate...It Could Be a Thing... 6/28: It Went Ka-Boom With My Son On It,1494633600,4.0,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/613UD4V2xVL._SY88.jpg'],,sports,a3041

shewee- when i used this product i had urine on my clothing. i tried using it 3 times with the same results. its very bulky and therefore not discrete, the clear tube must be used because the green funnel isn't long enough to exit the urine safely away from the body. it is made of hard plastic, so it will not collapse during use but still needs 2 hands because its so long and narrow you need to hold both ends. it comes with its own caring case, which is a plus. the part of the funnel you hold next to your body is extremely narrow, the funnel itself is so narrow if one was to release a large volume, quickly, i think it would overflow. you also need to wipe afterward because if you try to wipe yourself with it, its just to narrow, plus now you have 2 plastic pieces that are also wet (besides yourself and your clothing). this devise is generally hard to use, indiscrete (dark greenreally?) and bulky both to carry and use. i would give the shewee a rating of 1 star. i expected more from rei.

wiz freedom- out of the package, first try worked fine. its flexible and therefore needs both hands to keep it in place and prevent crimping. this devise was not very discrete, anyone seeing you from the side would wonder about this long bright pinkish-purple thing sticking out from between your legs. it doesnt come with a carrying case and i couldn't figure out how on earth i would carry this discreetly in my purse or use it in an emergency. it also  stays wet and theres the issue of self-clean-up, since you are wet after use. at least it doesnt wet your clothing so, i would give this 2 stars.

go girl- no leaking on first try, more difficult with elastic clothing due to the flexibility of the product, good discretion, you do need to use both hands to hold it tight to your body and keep it from crimping. i liked that it folded in half- and i could fit it into a small iphone case on my waist when not in use! i didn't like that there was still moisture in the devise and on my body when i finished, and therefore needed to wipe myself and figure out what to do with the paper. i would give this product 3 stars.

pstyle- worked great out of the package. just the right length, the color option of semi-clear lavender makes it discrete as well. because this devise is made of semi-flexible smooth plastic with rounded edges you can effectively use it to wipe yourself, when you are done. by gently pressing up and away from yourself, you are virtually dry- the last few drops go out the end. if you shake it, the pstle is virtually dry. as well if you want to really get it clean, just use a little water from your water bottle to shoot down the spout. if you buy the caring case you can pop the pstyle in there quickly and easily,  and carry on without any fuss. the case just looks like an eyeglasses case and is totally washable with a velcro closure. the case also comes in a blue-jean material, it can be hung on a belt loop or on the outside of a bag, purse or backpack with its mini carabiner. because it is semi-ridged it requires only 1 hand in the middle to hold it in place it won't collapse. it also will not overfill or back-up because it is not a funnel, its more of a half-pipe. this is the only one i use now. i would give the pstle 5 stars, with a big thank you to the people who designed and distributed this product.",I Tried 'Em All- Not Recommened,1433980800,205.0,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vE2HDpbpL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816p9iepDiL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-lLGe6HlL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81T9+56X-OL._SY88.jpg']",{'Color:': ' Nato Green'},sports,a3049

this item failed after the first try at locking it - even before i used it on my bag.

you are supposed to push in the cable release (large button on the side) to allow you to adjust the amount of cable you pay out from the lock. when you are done adjusting the length, you release the button, and it is supposed to pop back out and lock the cable at that length.

after the first try at using it, the cable button would not pop back out, which not only allowed the cable to spool back in, but it also blocks you from inserting the cable tip into the lock. apparently the button must be out before you can insert the cable tip into the locking mechanism.

if you jimmy it enough you can get the button to pop back out, but the very next time you push the button, the thing jambs again.

like a lot of people, i struggle with mosquitoes every summer.  and every year i try to find some new gimmick to deal with them.  even though i know, know, they likely won't work, i keep trying.  this repellent coil was one of my latest efforts and it didn't deliver.

the actual quality of this product is lacking.  the small metal base you attach the coil to is extremely flimsy.  wedging the end of the coil on to the metal base isn't terribly difficult, but the metal is so thin that you have to carefully position it so that it will stay upright.  the coil itself is quite brittle and breaks into pieces quite easily.  one of the pieces arrived broken and the intact one broke through (i consider) fairly gentle contact.  i was able to jury-rig a solution using the base plate at an angle to support the pieces of the coil, but obviously that isn't something you should have to do.

all this aside, the main selling point of this product is its ability to repel mosquitoes, and it does not do this.  i did not take a careful before and after survey about the number of mosquitoes, so i will admit it is possible this product has some repellent properties, but in general even after it had been burning for a while i saw, heard, and felt mosquitoes.

in the end this is yet another mosquito repellent that doesn't work and has a shoddy design to boot.",Shoddy design and it simply doesn't work,1509840000,,,{'Size:': ' 10 pack'},sports,a3116

i feel it shouldn't be this difficult for someone to eventually sort out the proper way to use this tool, especially considering the price. at the end of the day, it is useful. it is accurate but its accuracy (again, for my unit) it is no better than my $17 wheeler spring gauge. the measurements between the two were within 2 oz. for an average of 10 measurements of the singe stage canjar trigger on my pre-64 model 70 (3#-4oz for the lyman and 3#-2oz for the wheeler).

if you like digital stuff and you do a lot of measurement on a regular basis, i.e. professional gunsmiths or firearms testers, the lyman is great and its quirks of use will be a non-issue. if you just need to verify your rifle to check its pull weight to confirm the accuracy of advertised pull weight or verify work you have had done, there are less expensive alternatives.",Pretty good tool but a bit spendy unless you're a pro,1469232000,,,,sports,a3171

my original review below was very positive
but
about a month after it - the lights on the left pedal began to work intermittently or not at all. i contacted pedalite's customer service twice over the space of a month and got no response.
and now 6 months after purchase - i had to replace these pedals as the bearings on the right pedal started grinding really badly.
i thought this was a quality product with a good company standing behind it.
i guess i was wrong.

 after a long time searching and reading the other reviews of this product i went ahead and ordered a set of pedalite pedals plus the toe clips.  when they arrived they looked well made and the attachment of the clips reinforced this impression. my local bike store had only one set of pedals with toe clips (not pedalites) and the bearings on one of the set i looked at were definitely dodgy. the solution was to go through the five pairs in hand and select two that seemed okay - so much for quality control.
anyway, after installing the pedalite pedals + clips i went out for a ride and these pedals were really great - not being able to use clipless pedals- these were really a good compromise. but - i noted that the friction lights on the left pedal were not working - i was mad - i'd checked them out before installation and now in just 10 minutes one wasn't working. i could take the pedals off the bike, remove the clips and contact amazon for a replacement set - a real hassle or i could just live with the defective pedal. others however, had noted that pedalite stood behind their products so i went to their website and lo and behold there was a note about the microchips sometimes not functioning and needing 24 hours to reset themselves. i went out and checked my bike and the left pedal lights were now working! and if they were not, pedalite clearly states they will replace them. this is a good product from a good company - no need to look further if you need flat pedals with toe clips.",Junk,1275177600,9.0,,,sports,a3273

-this item is described as ""soft"" which is simply not true.  they have about as much give as cork bar-tape, or maybe a fully inflated basketball.  that being said, i am a firm believer that soft/cushy grips don't help.  the real strength of this kind of grip is in the ""ergonomic"" shape. the purpose of the wings is to keep your wrists straight, not to provide a platform for you to lay your wrists out flat.  if these grips are positioned properly, they will keep your wrists straight with your forearm, which is desirable as it reduces strain on your wrists.

installation:
-i've read that a lot of other reviewers used hairspray or some other kind of fixative to install these on their handlebars.  i recommend using a water-based, ""personal"" lubricant (i used astroglide).  apply a very thin layer to the handlebars and slide the grips on.  the lubricant will allow the grips to slide on easily, and will become sticky when it drys.  one note though, this method will still allow some movement if you apply a lot of twisting force.

complaints:
-my hands are large, and i can easily wrap my hands entirely around these grips with decent overlap.  because of this, my palms often rest on the apex of the wings, and can become sore.  i would complain about the lack of a tightening ring, but that is the kind of feature you find on much more expensive grips.

extra notes:
-you can use these with grip shifters, but i do not recommend it, as they are much too long for that, and will keep your hands away from the shifters at most times (also the combination looks ridiculous).

overall, i would reccomend this to folks who need a wireless method of monitoring heart rate, who wouldn't want to spend $50 or more. once you realize the ""limits"" of the wireless it's managable, though i will say i'm surprised the timex brand is on here.. the overall function seems to be of a different brand. cheaper units exist but their ratings are far worse.

pros:

* acceptable price

* chest strap is adjustable

* chest strap has quick on/off ""clips"" so you can simply wrap it around you and go

* the strap seems pretty sensitive and picks up the heartbeat easily

* the ""beep"" per pulse isn't as loud as some reviews described it.. in fact, unless it's dead-quiet in a room it's not that noticable to myself. if you're trying to hear it, you can, but it's very subtle. in an office setting, folks don't even notice it.

* big display readout

* sweat alone was perfect to help assist the strap in taking measurements

cons:

* setting the time and moving through the functions is annoying.. it's how the design is setup, you'd have to see it to understand what i mean

* it will read fine if i'm sitting down in an office chair or on a couch, but won't read at all while sitting in a car, no matter how i adjust the seat or my position. almost wonder if there's wireless interference.

* on several occasions when the arm was moved away from the normal ""running"" position (further to the side of the body), the watch lost connection and it never could re-connect. i had to stop and manually tell the watch to ""re-start"", and hold the watch close for it to re-connect

* while sitting, the watch won't always pick up the wireless connection, but it almost always will when standing, even though for both positions the chest strap is steadily beeping on the pulse

* the button you use to swap between pulse and clock is annoying. sometimes just pressing it works, sometimes you have to hold it to shut down the pulse to see the clock, or to go back to the pulse.","Easy to use, provides pretty accurate results",1336435200,,,,sports,a3306

all of the parts were there and contrary to other reviews, i found the instruction manual quite detailed, logical, and got be through to completion of build in about 1 1/2 hrs. they had pictures of the specific parts and exactly how they attach. perhaps schwinn took some of the older reviews to heart and made an updated assembly manual for this year's model.

one problem i found was the the seat was tilted to the right. i put it on a level and i showed that the seat frame
assembly is skewed a bit that causes the right tilt.  i called the 800 # and spoke to customer service yesterday (9/11/12)and the rep (who was very pleasent) said that they had a new seat and seat post in stock and would send it to me.

another problem that developed during my first test ride yesterday was a loud clicking sound when you stop pedaling and start to coast. the anoying sound comes from the back ""free-hub"" and resonates to the front crank/bottom bracket area.

i am going to call customer service tomorrow and see what can be done for this issue.  i did notice that a person that did a review on this bike and gave it a 1 star, experienced the same noise i did. he said:

""p.s. if you experience a noise near the rear of the trike, it is due to poor design and craftsman ship. as there are two very large spacers between the bearings (that the drive shaft passes through) that are detached and move about while you ride. pacific cycles recommend that you oil and tighten the outer bolts of the drive shaft a few time and that will fix the noise. wrong! to fix this have someone weld some inserts in the hubs of the rear end so that the bearings don't push through (yes it is too much work).

(update) well, this one just like my first one, broke and the funny thing is, that it broke in the same place which was the chain for the driving shaft.""

*update 9/14/12:
i spoke with customer service and they were familiar with my noise issue and said the same thing they told the guy above.  well, after disassembling the rear axle and the 4 bearing and the two hollow spacers, i found that the problem was that the drive shaft (axle) was bowed.  i told customer service that and she said that she was sending me new bearings, spacers and axle.  i'm finding that this bike is more trouble than it is worth, but i'm going to install the new parts when they come and hope it works...if not, it's going back to amazon.

*update 9/22/12
well, the replacement axle, bearings, and spacers arrived, and after installing them the same noise continued. i now believe that the problem lies with the two seperate parts of the frame (where the axle goes through) are not lined-up with each other and causing the axle to not freely rotate.  it will rotate, but it's as if it's spring loaded and stops at one rotation.

anyway, bottom line, it's going back to amazon and i'll look for another bike. too bad, because if it weren't for this issue, it's otherwise a pretty good bike for the money.","Schwinn Meridian Adult 26"" 3-Wheel bike",1347408000,6.0,,,sports,a3310

so, while i'm not too disappointed with this hoist, the things that concern me are the fraying of the cable and the winch handle. this cable is fraying way too soon. the handle is too thin and bends easily while cranking an item over 200 pounds.

i'm going to have to replace the winch handle, soon. and, the cable will also have to be replaced, if i wish to continue using this hoist.

for the price, the hoist was okay. but, if i'm going to have to shell out for replacement parts so soon, it's not that great of a deal, anymore.

i recently purchased kill shot game hoist for just a little more (500 lb. capacity), and it's more than worth the money. much better quality winch, etc.

if you only need a quick hoist for small jobs, this hoist should do (but, you'll still have to replace some of the parts). however, if you need something sturdy for a longer haul, i'd recommend trying something else.","Okay, but not great.",1384214400,21.0,,,sports,a3317

this tool is a cross between a simple solid lockback knife and a multi-tool, and tool logic has chosen the route of austerity, with just the basics.  i like the knife, the pliers are passable, but i'm not impressed with the screwdriver.

this product offers only the following: a 2 3/4"" half-serrated lockback blade; a tiny pair of spring-loaded pliers; a slot for a tiny screwdriver with a tiny regular and philips-head bit; and another exactly the same flat/philips bit.

overall, the feel of the closed product is good, a little bit of heft, but not too heavy.  the pocket clip is good and tight, and it feels good in the pocket.  i note the three screws affixing the clip to the tool are necessarily bunched together in one spot, and there is a 3/8"" tongue over the knife's lockback spring.  having carried many lockbacks over the years, i suspect that long-term use will loosen these bunched-up screws.

the knife is fine, and opens easily with one hand.  there is no thumb stud, but a thumb hole instead.  a one-hand close is possible, but only if finishing the close against another surface.  the blade is substantial, a full 1/16"" wide along its back.  there is no secondary lock for the blade (as you'll find in most crkt knives, and some others).

opening the tool exposes the pliers.  there is no locking mechanism to prevent the tool from opening if the knife blade is open.  the pliers are pretty dinky, all of 1/16"" wide at the tip and 3/16"" wide at the very back, 15/16"" deep until you reach the wire cutter.  the wire cutter itself is also tiny, all of 3/16"" deep.  the pliers are spring-loaded, with an open spring making an audible ""squink"" as you work the pliers.  the spring is secured at one end, and moves freely inside a small trace on the other; the spring seems exposed to me, and i believe it would only be a matter of time until it's lost (it is fully concealed when the tool is closed).

the screwdriver is dinky, too.  the flat blade is only 1/8"" wide.  there are two bits, both the same, with the flat blade and a philips head on the other end.  the hex bit slides into the tool and is retained by a tiny spring ball.  there is nothing covering or protecting the screwdriver when the tool is closed, other than the bit being below the profile of the tool's handle.  the extra bit fits into a channel in the handle, and is held in place by the plastic pincer action of the tool's outside plastic housing.  this bit is accessible through a thumb detent, but this also allows the extra bit to see-saw in its slot; using the see-saw motion i rocked the bit out in as few as three moves and always in less than 15.  this is not really a good way to store this extra bit; i expect it will fall out and be lost very quickly.

bottom line: this is not a bad tool, but it's not for me.  it's too much to carry in to work or to keep in a pocket with a suit and tie.  but it's not enough for most of my applications.  if i'm going camping or working outside and expect to need basic tools, i'll clip my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/crkt-knife/dp/b0047q3prs/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8"">crkt knife</a>&nbsp;in my pocket and hang my trusty&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/leatherman/dp/b0009js2zw/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8"">leatherman</a>&nbsp;in its worn pouch on my belt.  that way i'll have all the basic tools i need, most of which this tool does not offer, and in the larger sizes i'm most likely to require.  this product will find a place in my car's emergency kit.","Two Tools in One, Barely",1295913600,15.0,,,sports,a3329

1. the silver-y part in the middle of the lock wobbles around and seems kind of flimsy. i'm not sure why that it is, and i don't know if it affects the security of the lock over-all, but it kind of bothers me. generally i expect a u-lock to feel pretty solid.

2. the keys could, as other reviews mentioned, be a little better. they seem about as flimsy as the silver thing. i haven't had a chance to really use it a lot, though, so i'm not sure if that's just perception or what.

3. the lock does have rubber padding on it to prevent scratches to the bike frame, but i feel it could be 'softer'. the lock can still easily damage the paint given a little bumping around.

4. the process for registering the lock and signing up for anti-theft protection could be made a lot more convenient (both for customers and for the company) if onguard really wanted it that way. my guess is that they intentionally make it inconvenient in order to deter people from actually signing up for it. for example, you must send the registration form in by mail within 15 days of purchase (not receipt) of the lock, and you must include a receipt for or appraisal of the bicycle. make sure you've got all your papers in order before you buy it!

i subtract one star for the sheath. in order to remove the poly sheath from it's nylon platform ( to lash the inverted sheath to my pack-strap) you must remove the 2 tiny screws that help hold the two together. fine, except that they simply just strip out the plastic hex-shaped recess that holds the nut. the tiny nuts can be seen in some of the pics others have posted here. so, you can turn, turn , turn the tiny bolts all you want, but the plastic isn't strong enough to secure the recessed nuts on the other end to turn it off the threads. it just strips the plastic out.
poorly executed. i suppose i can find a way to get the bolts out without actually drilling them out, but really, i shouldn't have to now should i?
if they simply installed small metal bushings, or just did not recess the one end into the thin plastic, everything would have been fine, but they didn't.

it seemed that the presta valve would remain closed when i tried to pump with it, no air was getting in. it was infuriating that i could not get it to work. the review that said it doesn't work for presta valves rang true for me, and there were no instructions to help further.

after about an hour of fiddling, i found that you can loosen or tighten the tip on the end of the chuck. this will cause the inner seal ring to depress more or less, depending on how much tightness you need. this is a trial and error adjustment and took a while. you want the right amount of grip and clearance once the valve is inside the chuck.

once i got the tip tightened just right, it worked just as well as any other presta pump i've used before.

i can totally understand people swearing off this unit, as the instruction should include this crucial piece of info, and chances are unlikely that the ring seal will be adjusted perfectly after purchase. but hey, even a novice cyclist and general underachiever such as myself figured it out...in time.

other than that, the grips are great for target shooting. they definitely give your a better purchase on the pistol. however, if you plan on pocket-carrying this (for us law-abiding ccw holders), the grips add significant bulk to the pistol and the rubber catches on clothing. better to use a holster (iwb or owb).",Great grips - hard to install,1301011200,6.0,,,sports,a3464

i wrote a review of this light's bigger brother - the two led&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/metroflash-danger-zone/dp/b00aozhw3o/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8"">metroflash danger zone</a>&nbsp;- earlier this year and was very impressed with that. then this one turned up.

ostensibly it's less powerful than the dz (well, it has one 0.5w led as opposed to two), but it is still a force to be reckoned with and during night-time rides it will provide plenty of visibility. personally, i would prefer two leds (given the mentality of some drivers, i would prefer a bike mounted minigun, but that's beside the point) but one will do the job quite acceptably. ok, i'll admit that i'm cheating... i now have the danger zone and the night force hung on my backpack, so i am so well lit that i'm in danger of being landed on by boeing 747s on their way to heathrow.
the 0.5w led is also quite powerful enough to be seen during daylight.

the on-off button is an improvement on the dz - on that light it was very sensitive and prone to inadvertent switching. on the nf it's much less sensitive and won't accidentally turn on when you bump the light housing.

the two modes are steady, flash and off (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/cue-cardinal-fang-the-three-modes-are/dp/b000tec3ts/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8"">cue cardinal fang, the three modes are...</a>).

the light can be attached to the bike frame (bracket provided) or clipped to your clothing or rucksack. whichever you choose, please do be sure that the light isn't obscured by clothing, equipment or body parts and is pointed more or less horizontally. the number of apparently switched-on cyclists i have seen who have paid for a good light and then hidden it under their rucksack or pointed it at the sky beggars belief.

the batteries (2xaaa, supplied) should, from experience, last a season depending on usage (i tend to use flashing mode which is more noticeable and extends battery life considerably), but it may be wise to replace them half-way through as the leds can begin to fade as the batteries run down. it's also a good idea to carry spare batteries with you.","Brighter than Sunny Bono singing ""You light up my life"" with Grand Master Flash",1377993600,,,,sports,a3465

windstopping is good. fit is good. i normally wear a large button down shirt and/or jacket (size 42ish for a suit) and the large canari niagara is just right (for a cycling jacket that isn't supposed to drag in the wind). i posted a few images while wearing it to show fit and reflective quality. build is good and stitching looks durable. visibility is excellent. jacket is nice and warm at room temperature. i'll add some comments on the quality of the cold/wet barrier once i've logged a few miles in various conditions (too much snow/ice on the road to really test it at the moment).

the idea o having the bottle with compartments that roll into it is just great. we use the main body to bring water or juice, and then use the compartments for snacks, and we can carry all of it safely and easily as one single bottle! i also like that you can easily open the flap at the top to quickly drink from it.

the only thing i did not like is that the quality is not great. the plastic feels cheap, and i would have hoped for a little harder plastic. however, it is sturdy enough to survive our daily handling.

overall, a very well thought bottle that makes our life easier. and i guess you can use it for the gym too! :)

the not so good: these are not made for the grip they provide. while they are great for bars with good grip areas, the suede-like feel on the palms make it harder to grip smooth bars, especially when doing pulling motions like lat pull-downs, pull-ups, etc. and, while they seem to be made very well, i'm already having issues with some of the padding bunching up under one knuckle on the left glove. it is not a major malfunction, but it is a bit annoying to be lifting and feel that knot.

all that said, i like these gloves enough i'm going to keep them (if i can figure out how to get that knot out), as i said they are the best made gloves i've had. hopefully the grip gets better as i break these in some more.","Good, could have better grip though.",1437436800,,,"{'Size:': ' Small', 'Color:': ' One Color'}",sports,a3512

i currently own a rcbs case tumbler and plan to purchase another soon.
i was looking for a sooner-than-later 3rd option to start dedicating mediums (instead of constantly swapping out from one medium to another, depending on operation, etc.)
keeping costs below what i expected to pay for another rcbs, i stumbled upon the frankfort arsenal quick-n-ez case tumbler.
pictures weren't really helpful in regards to the quality of construction, noise is always a factor on vibratory units.  price was almost ""too good to be true"" for my standards.

i'll report that when the unit arrived, the packaging was shockingly well made for such an inexpensive product.  don't be confused though, it was nothing to write home to mom about. ;)  just a cost ratio observation.
nothing was damaged inside and assembly was finished in less than 5 minutes.  ""destructions"" were glanced over afterwards, which are well written missing only a binding *chuckle*  pictures make assembly for even a child poka-yoke.  tumbling tips are provided as well and a must read for any novice reloader.  take note that even when this unit is purchased independently, it appears that the rotary separator assembly and the quick-n-ez case tumbler share assembly & usage instructions.  thought out, controlled documents, ftw!  kudos.
with past experience with vibratory units, i took the liberty to add a medium strength thread locker to the threads, even though star-lock washers were included.  (i also replaced the star-lock washers with split-lock washers and relocated them inside the cavity where the square nuts are placed for assembly, this prevents the unlikely chance that if the thread locker fails and the philips screw falls out, that i don't lose additional hardware in the process.)
the clear plastic lid is robust (thanks to the aggressive molding design) and clear enough to see the cases as they are agitated through the medium.
measured noise was a little higher than past tumblers i've owned, in the low-mid 70's db @ 30cm (with lid on + medium + a few dozen 7.62x63mm cases).  very acceptable in my workshop without numbing out any background music.

this is a lightweight blade. the handle is frn, deployment isn't as fast as the tanto because this blade is lighter, since there's less material. but i have no issues flipping it out with a strong flick of the wrist - i don't even need to use the thumb stud. closing it will take a little practice because the triad lock is so strong, but that's also a benefit - the lock won't disengage accidentally for the same reason. cs knives are as close to fixed blades as you're going to get.

it does charge to 10 watts and will re-charge the nano grid light system battery and will operate the flex-light with great brightness.
it will also recharge over camp/backpack stoves in the wild.
i have found that using a butane stove i can get a full charge in 2 hours. using an isobutene stove i could only get a 3/4 charge on a full 210 gram cartridge, finished the charge on the propane stove.
using the gas kitchen stove on high i could only get a 3/4 charge, but was able to finish it off again on the propane stove.
 i have not attempted to use the bio lite stove for a charge just because of the soot coating it would have on the kettle charge.
once charged i was able to re-charge my nano-grid battery from the cold kettle charge within 3 hours. i was also able to charge the nano grid battery lite while charging the kettle charge with the various stoves.
the nano lite will charge using the computer usb in 3 hours, and using a car charger in 3 to 4 hours.
i tried charging the nano-grid  on the bio lite stove, but after 6 hours had only managed 1/4 charge.
so, the kettle charge is a great boon to being able to charge the nano-grid light system in the wild and will also independently operate the super bright flex-lite and is capable of charging all electronics below laptop capacity, and all from a boiling pot.
how can you beat this.
just make sure to carry extra fuel for the kettle-charge and plenty of water. i went through 4 to 5 bottles of 16 oz. water just to get a full charge from a dead empty battery.
with the kettlecharge, the nanogrid light system, the flexlight and the biolite stove you can have a completely self sustaining cooking, lighting and recharge system. add a propane stove and it can all be done faster.",This is a great product.

the slide was held in place via the thumb screw very securely but it was hard to keep it level, keep the sight pusher straight and tighten by myself. i ended up having someone help me hold the slide straight and put downward pressure on the slide pusher as i pushed the sight out. using a bench vice with soft jaws would keep the tool from moving and you can use a block of wood on the bottom of the slide to keep it level or just the width of the vice.

i didn't think the velcro would be enough to protect the slide so i used some door weather stripping and that was a failure, i switched to the velcro and it worked great leaving no marks on the slide.",Easy to use sight pusher,1484179200,,,,sports,a3698

some guns love this ammo, others, not so much. seem to perform better in the more powerful guns. solid construction and shallow skirt means less deformed pells and above average penetration.

not commonly known, but these pells have a very high ballistic coefficient, which means they shed less velocity en-route than most designs.

in my nitro piston rifle i'm getting 720 fps, and pass-through shots on big fox squirrels.

between these and hobby pells, all my ammo needs are pretty much covered
(i do alot of accuracy testing on targets)

good luck!",Decent pells,1486425600,,,,sports,a3699

(it's difficult for adults, too, but for a different reason: unless you have really tiny hands, it's hard to fit your hand inside to pull them out.)

toddler and i have tried to do this as a shared effort:  she sticks her hands inside and brings the block up to the opening in the flap, and if i manage to coordinate my hand just right, i can put one finger through one of the shape holes and give it enough of a push to get it through the flap and free it into her hands.  but this requires great coordination on my part and great patience on hers, and as often as not she gets frustrated and gives up before i can maneuver it into her hands.

first of all;
  the art, color palate and game pieces are all first rate. this is no surprise, because days of wonder always makes quality family games. they really do a great job in that department. typically i don't care for little cardboard ""chits"" that represent units in most wargames and mem. 44 has great miniatures that represent those battlefield units. i love this part of the game and a definite draw to play mem. 44.

the rulebook is well written and everything was very clear (with nice illustrations to help visualize correct rules in practice). how many times have you read a rule book and been frustrated? (probably more times than you can count because it's hard to make a good one).

the box is a great square size and everything fits well. the cardboard is nice and thick and will hold up over time. i can't tell you how many times, i have seen bad boxes for board games! this one is great!

now the rules and ""mechanics"" of mem'44 is odd (to say the least). it is a card based system that gives you limited actions. if you didn't draw a ""move left"" card, then.... you can't move in that direction. if you didn't draw air support or artillery, then again... no fire support. so often i needed to counter my opponent with moving units to support ""x"" or ""y"", but i didn't have the cards to support it. that would be like playing chess and not being able to do it, because you didn't have the cards or ""orders"" to do it. it's so frustrating that i was screaming inside my head ""please give me the card to do ""x""!"" (when i drew up). nothing felt right.... to the fire of my units to having no morale. i really don't understand why so many people love this mem. 44 card based system for a wargame, there are so many better rules and systems out there!

i have played many historical miniature games from the napoleonic period and others... and i have played many wargames on the pc, and i have never had my hands tied so much in a game! how can you play a military commander or general and not be able to control your units? i just don't get it. maybe this game is supposing your a lieutenant taking orders from a general (e.g. action cards) where you have so little control? because that is the only explanation i can hypothesize.

however, after all those negative words.... this is a nice little light wargame for children or people who don't know anything about history. it has great text in the rule book to enlighten the non-war (non-historical) public, and that is great. it can be an entry into the genre of wargames too, but honestly this game is not for me. if you want to have an enjoyable historic, armchair-general experience, try another game.

so to end, this game is well produced, beautiful, and for the price it's a fairly good value. just know, it's like playing chess when you were a teenager and your dad sitting behind you... telling you... you can only move knight piece to the left... or the castle piece to ""x"" location... and that's it! memoir 44 simply is one extremely frustrating experience after another.

good luck and game on!

i also question including where the wild things are as one of the books.  i love the book, and my sons do too, but it's not a baby book---it's probably fine for 3 and up, but not really something a baby would relate to.  i think it's a choice to draw in parents, not babies.

well, no.  i set up the ant farm carefully, following all instructions.  i decided to get ants from my yard, as we have a huge amount of ants about.  the directions said to use an enclosed stick that the ants would climb on, and then put the stick into the enclosure and close it up.  i guess the ants near me are craftier than some, as they avoided the stick completely.  finally, i found a stick that some ants were already on that was small enough to put in the hole in the farm, and got some ants in.

so---i waited eagerly for ant action.  and saw---ants walking all over the outside of the farm.  i checked all the openings---they seemed securely fastened.  then i noticed something pushing itself out of the tiny airholes on the top.  it was an ant.  they looked a lot bigger than the holes, but somehow, they could get out of them.  and they all did. so now they have a bigger house---my house.

i think i would have done better with the ants you send away for, but i imagine most kids who get a farm like this will be eager to get started with it, and will choose to find their own ants.  i guess i needed bigger ants, but these ants were the standard size i find around my house.  and they still could sneak out---although i think it might have injured some of them, which was not good to see.  i didn't have the heart to try again with a new batch of ants.  so---if you do buy this, try sending away for ants to put in it.  or maybe just enjoy watching ants outside.",The ants I caught all were able to squeeze out of the air holes---now my living room is their ant treehouse,1471046400,10.0,,,toys,a4036

 you squeeze out a plastic compound on a protective plastic sheet, following a pattern to make objects. every few moments, you have to cure the plastic with what appears to be an ultraviolet light (for which  you have to supply three aaa batteries which are consumed quickly).

 yes, kids can create objects if they exercise just a bit of care. and the kids  if they have some patience and a tolerance for the tedium of squeeze and cure  think its fun. at7 least once.

the working headlights and tail lights are really neat. when he uses it in the dark it's kinda fun to see the lights come around the corner. it seems like it is rugged but takes a lot of battery power, which is used up in about an hour. you will need 2 aaa for the controller and 6 aa for the car. the 2 little plastic rear view mirrors are awkward.

from a parent's perspective, the three figures are the best part of this set. my kids carry them around everywhere, and they offer lots of opportunities for imaginative play. the three figures have eaten all kinds of ""food,"" ridden toy horses with play-doh ""saddles"" holding them on... oh, and also slid down the slide & rocked on the dino!

i think my twins might say they liked the flower best, surprisingly. they love snapping the top of the flower on & off the stem, and then snapping the stem onto the ""grass"" base. they also snap the bench on & off the grass base.

the first thing they learned when they got the set was how to make the figures bend at the waist to sit on the bench. it took some coaching to help them understand how to let go of the figures at the top of the slide so they'll slide down. once they understood, they had fun with that for a while. they can't snap the figures onto the dino rocker by themselves yet, but that will come. once the figures are on the rocker, they like to spin the dino around and make it rock. they also like to ""feed"" the dino.

my biggest complaint about this set is that the fit of the pants is cut too small. when we put the shorts on ken when he's standing up, the velcro barely closes around his rear. when you try to have him sit down, the velcro pops open and his whole rear is hanging out, literally. despite that issue, my daughter still likes the set and it's her favorite one to dress him in, but the manufacturer could improve the pants though.","Cute and Casual Set for Ken, Pants Cut Small So He Can't Sit Without Splitting Them",1429142400,9.0,,{'Configuration:': ' Summer Set'},toys,a4283

like it's predecessor, the beastmaster is trained in the nature school (and fire spells cost triple).  once per round she can place a ""wounded prey"" marker on a wounded non-mage living enemy creature (everyone who attacks that creature gets melee +1). she also has the fast trait, and ranged +1 for all non-spell ranged attacks.

like it's predecessor the priestess, the priest is trained in the holy school (and dark spells cost triple). he has the ""holy avenger"" special ability,  which is similar to the beastmaster's ""pet"" and the durid's ""treebond"" except it works on an holy rather than an animal or plant. once per round he can pay 1 mana to place a burn token on a creature he damages with an attack.

on the one hand, i liked the original beastmaster and priestess quite a bit and a little better than these, and i would rather have gotten new mages than different versions of existing mages (the reasons for 4 rather than 5 stars). on the other hand there are lots of new spells in this set making it a worthwhile addition in general, and for any beastmaster and priest(ess) in particular; it's always nice to have variety, and what's included will increase the games replayability even further.","Two variations of existing mages, plus lots of useful spells for these and other mages",1406419200,,,,toys,a4293

first let me address concerns others reviewers have raised about noise.  this might be a unit specific issue as ours while not whisper quiet is also not so loud as to be unbearable as some other have said.

how it works.  a light bar covered in leds spins in a circluar motion along the inside edge of the unit.  that spinning is what is creating the (in some cases loud) noise and what generates the light patterns.  much like those dollar store toys that feature the spinning leds on a wand-like toy.  a sensor in the ight pen then marks when a certain color will flash.  pretty cool tech in my humble opinion.  the downside is that the resolution of the designs are fairly low, though still offereing a lot of potential.

therefore creating 360 degree led-lit designs is fun and a lot of creativity can be had but erasing them or finding the built in games or switching colors or pen/ink thickness just isn't as straightforward at it should be.  this is possibly due to the limitations of the screen resolution or display format but there is quite a steep learning curve that the intructions only marginally address.

in summary, the child that has the patience to invest the time learning how to use the machine and has the creative spark that could be fueled by this device is the perfect candidate to use this machine.  for those that just want to fire it up and get coloring in light, this might not be the best fit.",Works but is a bit confusing to use,1365206400,3.0,,,toys,a4306

one strange thing, as it is with a lot of dolls, is that the legs are a little strange. sometimes i play octopus legs with my daughter. other than that, and it only comes up if the dolls dress gets caught on something, they are amazing.

due to the similarities, i'm going to start all my reviews with that bit above, then differentiate for each doll.

jasmine is different than the others.  as i mentioned above, the legs can be a bit odd, but most of the dolls have dresses...or fins.  jasmine however is the only one who wears pants.  this poses an odd problem.  she can either be much sorter than the other dolls or she has to have those crazy long legs mostly in view.  i think they made the right choice, but wowza.  those suckers are long.  they are long enough that my 3 year old stares at them wondering why they are so strange.  other than that, the quality is still there and i do recommend the doll either way","Good Jasmine Doll, High quality as always",1431302400,,,,toys,a4323

the kite is great to watch (and hear!). the bright red, white and blue stripes stand out against the sky, the long tail flicks in the wind and the streamers make a rustling sound. and it does soar! it will climb rather quickly. the polyester material is strong and creates great resistance to the wind that helps it climb high. the fiberglass rods are strong as well. the days i have flown mine, the wind has been pretty active, more than just a gentle breeze, but the rods never wavered and haven't snapped. the last photo in my slideshow is the kite out nearly the full 100 feet. i only had a little bit still on the string winder... the kite is a great value because it's not only easy for most kids to fly, but it also flies well and lasts without snapping rods or disintegrating in the wind, like soem of the foil-type one we used to get as kids. it's a great way to have some outdoor fun with the family.",A Great Value Kite For Everyone,1445299200,,,,toys,a4326

canterlot castle is an impressive playset once it is assembled and it takes quite of bit of time to assemble it.  my daughter and i spent almost an hour putting it together.  the lack of correct instructions is the reason that we gave it four stars.  there are 11 steps to put the castle together and the very first step is backwards.  we started assembling the castle as we were shown and then had to redo the bottom level once we say the box.  it wasn't that big of a deal to us, as we quickly figured what was wrong and reversed the panel inserts and base.  if you do not turn these pieces then the rest of the castle will not assemble like it should.

the castle itself is 29 tall when assembled and dwarfs the other castles, homes, and shops in the my little pony world.  this set comes with more than 40 different accessories to enjoy while you are playing with your ponies.  the rooms in the castle include a throne/bedroom, bathroom, kitchen/bakery and library as well as a working elevator that is in the form of celestias throne and doors that open and close.  in addition, your princess can use part of one of the turrets to use as a tiara for herself.

to make this playset even more fun, the cutie mark magic refers to seven different secret symbols that you find throughout the castle and on princess celestias front leg.  once you have downloaded the my little pony friendship celebration app for your phone or tablet you can scan the symbols to unlock features in the app.

overall, this is an amazing playset.  with so many accessories and possibilities if your child is like mine, she will play with it for a very long time without getting bored!

on a side note, my daughter did question if they are going to be building playsets for the equestria dolls that are now out.  shes would love to have playsets to play with those dolls as well.",An amazing playset but with limited inaccurate building instructions!

the basic concept of rialto is that players are trying to get control of six districts in venice, by placing their councilmen markers in these districts, using the majority area control mechanic.  but the really interesting aspect of the game comes through playing cards, which will let you do things like get money, place bridge or gondola tiles to connect the districts and determine their point values, buy buildings, and place councilmen.  gameplay happens over three phases, the first being the selection of cards, the second being the playing and resolving of cards, and the third being the activation of blue buildings. buildings can be activated in each phase, and really help players by giving special abilities that you'll try to maximize.

the components are decent, and while the game is perhaps not stefan feld's most elegant design, it is certainly a lighter design that is quite accessible in terms of rules and gameplay.  even so,  there are still tough choices and difficult decisions to be made, especially in terms of card selection, and hand management.  one of the most interesting elements of rialto is how the majority bonuses work, especially in  how players can get bonuses by playing the most cards of a type - eeking out the advantages from these bonuses is key to winning the game!  rialto feels much more interactive than many other euro games, including ones by feld, largely because of how the fight for majorities is key to the whole game.  the buildings also add a real degree of interest and opportunity for clever play.  there are several different ways to score points in rialto, and the different strategies all seem quite balanced.  rialto works well with anything from 2 to 5 players (and is indeed excellent as a two player game, especially with the dummy player variant), and expect the game to last around 15-20 minutes a player.

rialto is unlikely to be considered feld's masterpiece because it's a lighter game than some of his other designs, and in the long run it probably won't be mentioned in the same breath as titles like castles of burgundy or trajan. nevertheless, this is a very solid game that does exactly what it sets out to do: provide an accessible, interactive, satisfying, and fun light-weight euro. the components are attractive, the rules fairly straightforward, there are interesting choices to be made, and yet there's enough hidden information and random card draw to prevent things bogging down into pure calculation, and keeping it genuinely fun to play. rialto should find a comfortable and appreciated place on many gamer shelves in the foreseeable future. it's an excellent and interactive game in the light-medium weight category, and has the potential for a broad reach. - endersgame @ bgg",A great light-medium area-control strategy game from Stefan Feld,1378857600,3.0,,,toys,a4363

pros:
its a tank and tanks are cool.
pieces twist out from racks fairly cleanly. you might need hobby knife pr sand paper to clean up a nub once in a while.
it has enough pieces that following directions is required bit not so many the kid will get overwhelmed.
the plastic seems strong so breaking plastic during assembly is unlikely.
easy to apply a drop of glue here and there if you want.
durable. my kid dropped it 2 feet onto laminate floor and all it did was snap canon off. a couple drops of glue and its back in the fight.
price is excellent.

as for the frustration free packaging, it's my first experience with it.  honestly, i was a little thrown off and a bit disappointed that the toy didn't come in it's original colorful packaging, but arrived in the amazon brown box.  maybe i missed reading something, but i thought we would still get the box.  i put all of the pieces and instruction sheet in a christmas gift bag, and as far as opening this gift on christmas morning, i couldn't have been more pleased.  my son loved that he could pull the toy out and feel it and look at it and play with it right away.  no box necessary.  kids don't need a box to show them how to use their imagination!
