# Multiclass Classification of Amazon Product Ratings
`This was one of my projects for the CS74 Machine Learning class at Dartmouth College.`

In this project, @bilanaden1 and I use product reviews from Amazon to perform multiclass classification, where the goal is to classify the product rating on a five-class scale, ie the target classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. I built three multiclass classification models based on review text only. The three models were Perceptron, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest Classifier. I used functions in scikit-learn, numpy, and pandas. I compared the three different models using evaluation metrics such as confusion matrix, ROC AUC score, accuracy score, and macro F1 score.

Please look at the project write up, the pdf file uploaded in this repository, for a deep dive into this project description, processing, analysis, and results.
